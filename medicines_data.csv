Pharmacology





                            Vitamin B1 converts carbohydrates, fatty acids and amino acids into energy, promotes healthy nerves, improves mood, strengthens the heart. Vitamin B6 forms RBCs, helps cells to make proteins, manufactures neurotransmitters e.g. serotonin and releases stored forms of energy, helps to prevent CVS diseases and stroke, helps to lift depression and eases insomnia. Vitamin B12 is essential for cell replication and important for RBC production, prevents anemia, helps to prevent depression, reduces nerve pain, numbness, tingling and lowers the risk of heart diseases.
The vitamin ingredients are absorbed well in per oral reception. It is widely distributed to most tissues and appears in breast milk. Within the cell, thiamine is mostly present as diphosphate. Thiamine is not stored to any appreciable extent in the body and amounts in excess of the body’s requirements are excreted in the urine as unchanged thiamine or as metabolites. Pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine are readily absorbed from the GIT following oral administration and are converted to the active forms of pyridoxal phosphate an pyridoxamine phosphate. They are stored mainly in liver where there is oxidation to 4-pyridoxic acid and other inactive metabolites, which are excreted in urine. As the dose increases, proportionally greater amounts are excreted unchanged in the urine.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            Tablet: 1-3 Tablets per day or as advised by the physician.

Indications





                            3-C is an orally active cephalosporin antibiotic which has marked in-vitro bactericidal activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism. It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms.
Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI)
: e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis.
Urinary Tract Infections
: e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. 3-C is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.

Pharmacology





                            Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.
                    




































Dosage & Administration





                            Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. 
Adults and children over 10 years
: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. 
Elderly
: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. 
Children
: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 




6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily


Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily


Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily




In typhoid
: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. 
Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years
: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. 
Children aged less than 6 months
: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.
Dosage in Renal Impairment
: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.

Interaction





                            In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients. Care should therefore be taken in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.
                    










Side Effects





                            3-C is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with 3-C are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            3-C should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with 3-C, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. 3-C should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 3-C should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Gastric Lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. 3-C is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Adverse reactions in small numbers of healthy adult volunteers receiving single doses up to 2 g of 3-C did not differ from the profile seen in patients treated at the recommended doses.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Third generation Cephalosporins
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Keep below 30ºC temperature, protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.

It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.
                    




































Dosage & Administration





                            Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. 
Adults and children over 10 years
: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. 
Elderly
: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. 
Children
: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 




6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily


Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily


Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily




In typhoid
: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. 
Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years
: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. 
Children aged less than 6 months
: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.
Dosage in Renal Impairment
: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.

Interaction





                            In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients. Care should therefore be taken in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.
                    










Side Effects





                            3-C is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with 3-C are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            3-C should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with 3-C, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. 3-C should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 3-C should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Gastric Lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. 3-C is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Adverse reactions in small numbers of healthy adult volunteers receiving single doses up to 2 g of 3-C did not differ from the profile seen in patients treated at the recommended doses.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Third generation Cephalosporins
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Keep below 30ºC temperature, protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.

Indications





                            3-C is an orally active cephalosporin antibiotic which has marked in-vitro bactericidal activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism. It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms.
Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI)
: e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis.
Urinary Tract Infections
: e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. 3-C is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.

                            3-Geocef is an orally active cephalosporin antibiotic which has marked in-vitro bactericidal activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism. It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms.
Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI)
: e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis.
Urinary Tract Infections
: e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. 3-Geocef is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.

Pharmacology





                            Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.
                    




































Dosage & Administration





                            Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. 
Adults and children over 10 years
: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. 
Elderly
: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. 
Children
: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 




6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily


Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily


Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily




In typhoid
: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. 
Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years
: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. 
Children aged less than 6 months
: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.
Dosage in Renal Impairment
: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.

Interaction





                            In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients. Care should therefore be taken in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.
                    










Side Effects





                            3-Geocef is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with 3-Geocef are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            3-Geocef should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with 3-Geocef, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. 3-Geocef should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 3-Geocef should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Gastric Lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. 3-Geocef is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Adverse reactions in small numbers of healthy adult volunteers receiving single doses up to 2 g of 3-Geocef did not differ from the profile seen in patients treated at the recommended doses.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Third generation Cephalosporins
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Keep below 30ºC temperature, protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.

Pharmacology





                            Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.
                    




































Dosage & Administration





                            Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. 
Adults and children over 10 years
: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. 
Elderly
: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. 
Children
: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 




6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily


Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily


Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily




In typhoid
: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. 
Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years
: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. 
Children aged less than 6 months
: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.
Dosage in Renal Impairment
: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.

Interaction





                            In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients. Care should therefore be taken in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.
                    










Side Effects





                            3-Geocef is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with 3-Geocef are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            3-Geocef should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with 3-Geocef, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. 3-Geocef should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 3-Geocef should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Gastric Lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. 3-Geocef is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Adverse reactions in small numbers of healthy adult volunteers receiving single doses up to 2 g of 3-Geocef did not differ from the profile seen in patients treated at the recommended doses.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Third generation Cephalosporins
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Keep below 30ºC temperature, protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.

Pharmacology





                            The active form of Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, exerts its effect by binding to the Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are widely distributed through many body tissues.Vitamin D3 has a half life of about 50 days as it is fat soluble.Vitamin D3 is absorbed in the small intestine and bound to specific a-globulins and transported to the liver where it is metabolised to 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcidiol). A second hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcitriol) occurs in the kidney. This metabolite is responsible for the vitamin's ability to increase the absorption of calcium. Non-metabolised Vitamin D3 is stored in tissues such as fat and muscle.Vitamin D3 is eliminated via faeces and urine.

Interaction





                            Many drugs cause Vitamin D3 deficiencies because they interfere with the absorption and metabolism of Vitamin D3 and includes Magnesium containing Antacids, Digoxin, Thiazide Diuretics, Cholestyramine, Cholistipol, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Orlistat,and Mineral Oil. Also, Corticosteroids, such as Prednisolone increase the need for Vitamin D3.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Vitamin D3 is contraindicated in all diseases associated with hypercalcaemia. It is also contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Vitamin D3 (or medicines of the same class) and any of the excipients. It is contraindicated if there is evidence of Vitamin D3 toxicity.
                    










Side Effects





                            Symptoms rarely include anorexia, lassitude, nausea & vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, weight loss, polyuria, sweating, headache, thirst, vertigo, and raised concentrations of calcium and phosphate in plasma and urine.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Studies have shown safe use of doses up to 4000 IU during pregnancy. The recommended daily intake for pregnant women is 400 IU, however, in women who are considered to be Vitamin D3 deficient a higher dose may be required. During pregnancy women should follow the advice of their medical practitioner as their requirements may vary depending on the severity of their disease and their response to treatment
Vitamin D3 and its metabolites are excreted in breast milk. Overdose in infants induced by nursing mothers has not been observed; however, when prescribing additional vitamin D3 to a breast-fed child the practitioner should consider the dose of any additional vitamin D3 given to the mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Plasma-calcium concentration should be monitored at intervals in patients receiving high doses of Vitamin D3, in renal impairment, and during pregnancy & lactation. People using Digoxin and Thiazide Diuretics should consult a health care practitioner before supplementing with Vitamin D3. People with liver or kidney disease, primary hyperthyroidism, lymphoma, tuberculosis and granulomatous disease should consult a health care practitioner before supplementing with Vitamin D3.

Vitamin D3 is essential for the effective calcium and phosphate absorption required for healthy bones and teeth, preventing rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis.


Vitamin D3 is also essential to prevent pre-eclampsia during pregnancy and breast feeding as it is an essential nutrient for a growing infant.


Vitamin D3 has vital role on immunity boost up.

Pharmacology





                            The active form of Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, exerts its effect by binding to the Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are widely distributed through many body tissues.Vitamin D3 has a half life of about 50 days as it is fat soluble.Vitamin D3 is absorbed in the small intestine and bound to specific a-globulins and transported to the liver where it is metabolised to 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcidiol). A second hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcitriol) occurs in the kidney. This metabolite is responsible for the vitamin's ability to increase the absorption of calcium. Non-metabolised Vitamin D3 is stored in tissues such as fat and muscle.Vitamin D3 is eliminated via faeces and urine.

Interaction





                            Many drugs cause Vitamin D3 deficiencies because they interfere with the absorption and metabolism of Vitamin D3 and includes Magnesium containing Antacids, Digoxin, Thiazide Diuretics, Cholestyramine, Cholistipol, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Orlistat,and Mineral Oil. Also, Corticosteroids, such as Prednisolone increase the need for Vitamin D3.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Vitamin D3 is contraindicated in all diseases associated with hypercalcaemia. It is also contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Vitamin D3 (or medicines of the same class) and any of the excipients. It is contraindicated if there is evidence of Vitamin D3 toxicity.
                    










Side Effects





                            Symptoms rarely include anorexia, lassitude, nausea & vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, weight loss, polyuria, sweating, headache, thirst, vertigo, and raised concentrations of calcium and phosphate in plasma and urine.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Studies have shown safe use of doses up to 4000 IU during pregnancy. The recommended daily intake for pregnant women is 400 IU, however, in women who are considered to be Vitamin D3 deficient a higher dose may be required. During pregnancy women should follow the advice of their medical practitioner as their requirements may vary depending on the severity of their disease and their response to treatment
Vitamin D3 and its metabolites are excreted in breast milk. Overdose in infants induced by nursing mothers has not been observed; however, when prescribing additional vitamin D3 to a breast-fed child the practitioner should consider the dose of any additional vitamin D3 given to the mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Plasma-calcium concentration should be monitored at intervals in patients receiving high doses of Vitamin D3, in renal impairment, and during pregnancy & lactation. People using Digoxin and Thiazide Diuretics should consult a health care practitioner before supplementing with Vitamin D3. People with liver or kidney disease, primary hyperthyroidism, lymphoma, tuberculosis and granulomatous disease should consult a health care practitioner before supplementing with Vitamin D3.
                    








Use in Special Populations





                            The safety & efficacy of Vitamin D3 in children under 12 years have not been established.

Indications





                            3RD Cef is an orally active cephalosporin antibiotic which has marked in-vitro bactericidal activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism. It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms.
Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI)
: e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis.
Urinary Tract Infections
: e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. 3RD Cef is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.

Pharmacology





                            Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.
                    




































Dosage & Administration





                            Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. 
Adults and children over 10 years
: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. 
Elderly
: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. 
Children
: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 




6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily


Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily


Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily




In typhoid
: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. 
Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years
: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. 
Children aged less than 6 months
: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.
Dosage in Renal Impairment
: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.

Interaction





                            In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients. Care should therefore be taken in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.
                    










Side Effects





                            3RD Cef is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with 3RD Cef are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            3RD Cef should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with 3RD Cef, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. 3RD Cef should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 3RD Cef should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Gastric Lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. 3RD Cef is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Adverse reactions in small numbers of healthy adult volunteers receiving single doses up to 2 g of 3RD Cef did not differ from the profile seen in patients treated at the recommended doses.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Third generation Cephalosporins
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Keep below 30ºC temperature, protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.

Indications





                            3RD Cef is an orally active cephalosporin antibiotic which has marked in-vitro bactericidal activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism. It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms.
Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI)
: e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis.
Urinary Tract Infections
: e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. 3RD Cef is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.

Pharmacology





                            Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.
                    




































Dosage & Administration





                            Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. 
Adults and children over 10 years
: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. 
Elderly
: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. 
Children
: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 




6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily


Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily


Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily




In typhoid
: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. 
Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years
: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. 
Children aged less than 6 months
: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.
Dosage in Renal Impairment
: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.

Interaction





                            In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients. Care should therefore be taken in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.
                    










Side Effects





                            3RD Cef is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with 3RD Cef are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.

                            3RD Cef should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins.

                            Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. 
Adults and children over 10 years
: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. 
Elderly
: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. 
Children
: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 




6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily


Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily


Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily




In typhoid
: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. 
Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years
: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. 
Children aged less than 6 months
: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.
Dosage in Renal Impairment
: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.

Interaction





                            In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients. Care should therefore be taken in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.
                    










Side Effects





                            3RD Cef is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with 3RD Cef are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            3RD Cef should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with 3RD Cef, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. 3RD Cef should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 3RD Cef should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Gastric Lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. 3RD Cef is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Adverse reactions in small numbers of healthy adult volunteers receiving single doses up to 2 g of 3RD Cef did not differ from the profile seen in patients treated at the recommended doses.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Third generation Cephalosporins
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Keep below 30ºC temperature, protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.

Pharmacology





                            Fluorouracil is inactive as such in mammalian cells but is converted into the active 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) by a variety of different metabolic pathways. The drug works by inhibiting the enzyme thymidylate kinase which results in reduced formation of thymidine and thus of DNA. The active metabolite FdUMP appears to form a stable complex with the folate cofactor N-5, 10-methylene tetrahydrofolate which inactivates thymidylate kinase. Fluorouracil as FdUMP is also incorporated into RNA which results in fluorination of RNA. The effect of fluorouracil on living cells is limited mainly to those in the proliferative phase but while cells in the G2 and S phase are most affected there may be effects at any stage of the cell cycle.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            Intravenous 5-fluorouracil can be delivered by rapid intravenous bolus injection or slow infusion. The vial contents can rapidly be injected directly into a peripheral vein, the commonest schedules being: 12-13.5 mg/Kg (500 mg/m2) daily for 5 days repeated at 4-weekly intervals. Slow intravenous infusion requires the drug, to be diluted in 500 ml of dextrose 5% solution, then infused over 2-3 hr on 5 successive days.
For palliative management of cancer
: Initial Dose: 12 mg/kg intravenously once daily for 4 successive days. Maximum Dose: 800 mg/day. If no toxicity is observed, 6 mg/kg may be administered on the 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th day (No therapy is given on days 5, 7, 9, or 11). Discontinue at the end of day 12, even with no apparent toxicity.
Poor risk patients and those who are not in an adequate nutritional state
: Initial Dose: 6 mg/kg/day for 3 days. Maximum Dose: 400 mg/day. If no toxicity is observed, 3 mg/kg may be administered on days 5, 7, and 9 (No therapy is to be administered on days 4, 6, or 8). Discontinue at the end of day 9, even with no apparent toxicity.
Maintenance therapy
: In instances where toxicity has not been a problem, it is recommended that therapy be continued using either of the following schedules:




Repeat the dosage of the first course every 30 days after the last day of the previous course, or


When the toxic signs resulting from the initial course of therapy have subsided, administer a maintenance dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg/week as a single dose. Maximum Dose: 1g/week .The reaction by the patient to the previous course of therapy should be taken into account and the dosage should be adjusted accordingly.




Usual adult dose for cervical cancer
: In combination with cisplatin 1 gm/m2 IV on day 1. The cycle is repeated every 21 days.
Usual pediatric dose for malignant disease
: The manufacturer has reported that the safety and effectiveness of fluorouracil have not been established in children. However, the drug has been used in children following adult guidelines.
Intra-arterial infusion
: Fluorouracil has also been given by intra-arterial infusion for adult in doses of 5 to 7.5 mg/kg body weight is dissolved in 20-100 ml of 5% Dextrose solution and administered 10-20 days by using an infusion pump.
Combination with radiation
: Usual adult daily dose of 5-10 mg/kg body weight is given in combination with radiation according to systemic administration method or intra-arterial infusion method.
Combination with other anticancer drugs
: Fluorouracil is used alone or in combination in the adjuvant treatment of breast and gastro-intestinal cancer, and palliation of inoperable malignant neoplasms, especially those of the gastro-intestinal tract, breast, head and neck, liver, genito-urinary system, and pancreas. It is also used with cyclophosphamide and methotrexate in the combination chemotherapy of breast cancer. A usual adult dose of 5 to 10 mg/kg body weight daily is given in combination with other anticancer drugs every day or intermittently once to twice a week by systemic administration method or intra-arterial infusion method.

Interaction





                            Pre-treatment with cimetidine for 4 weeks led to increased plasma concentrations of 5 FU PhaRes following intravenous and oral administration in 6 patients. The effect was probably due to a combination of hepatic enzyme inhibition and reduced hepatic blood flow.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in patients that are severely debilitated or in patients with bone marrow suppression due to either radiotherapy or chemotherapy. It is likewise contraindicated in pregnant or breastfeeding women. It should also be avoided in patients that do not have malignant illnesses.
                    










Side Effects






Potentially life-threatening effects
: Severe effects from 5-5 FU PhaRes are related to the dosage and duration of therapy.
Cardiac effects
: Occasional case reports associating 5-5 FU PhaRes therapy with 'ischemic cardiac events' evidence against the autoimmune phenomenon is the fact that in several cases cardiotoxicity occurred within several hours of the first dose.
Hematological effects
: Potentially lethal effects caused by severe hematological toxicity may develop within the first 10 days of treatment being instituted but generally resolves within 3 weeks. At the recommended dose and schedule it is rather uncommon for hematological toxicity to be severe. Any ontribute to severe effects from 5-5 FU PhaRes on the blood-forming cells. Thus extensive prior irradiation or the concomitant use of cytotoxic drugs tend to exacerbate the severity of the hematological side effects of 5-5 FU PhaRes.
Neurological effects
: Effects on the central nervous system have been occasionally reported and cerebral ataxia is dose-dependent with an incidence of between 3.1 and 7%. Acute cerebellar syndromes and myelopathy have been described following intrathecal 5-5 FU PhaRes. Neurological syndromes may occur rarely after carotid artery perfusion in head and neck cancer. Other effects Allergic reaction (including difficulty in breathing, closing of the throat, swelling of the lips, tongue, or face, or hives), decreased bone marrow function and blood problems (extreme fatigue, easy bruising or bleeding, black, bloody or tarry stools, or fever, chills, or signs of infection), hand-foot syndrome (tingling, pain, redness, swelling or tenderness of the hands and feet), severe vomiting, diarrhoea, frequent bowel movements or watery stools, or sores in the mouth or throat, or stomach pain or heartburn or black, bloody or tarry stools. Other less serious side effects may include mild to moderate nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite, balance problems, confusion, rash and itching, or temporary hair loss. Conjunctivitis, both acute and chronic can proceed to tear duct stenosis and ectropion following prolonged administration. Very chronic administration, extending beyond 3 months, of low dosage has been associated with low systemic toxicity but includes the possibility of painful and tender hands and feet associated with erythema of the extremities.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Fluorouracil is contraindicated throughout pregnancy. The literature pertaining to pregnancy and cytotoxic drugs is necessarily limited but it appears in general that risk of teratogenesis diminishes with the advancement of pregnancy. Therefore most cytotoxic drugs are absolutely contraindicated in the first trimester and 5-fluorouracil, used in the first trimester has been reported to cause multiple congenital abnormalities. There are many case reports, however, of pregnancy being conducted successfully with combination chemotherapy being given to the mother during the second and third trimesters. Because of the age of the population and the natural history of the tumors treated, most of the data on long-term follow-up pertain to therapy for leukemias. More data need to be accrued on the subsequent development of neonates before it is certain that any of these compounds are free of late effects.
It is not known whether fluorouracil is excreted in human milk. Because fluorouracil inhibits DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, mothers should not nurse while receiving this drug.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            5-5 FU PhaRes is highly toxic drug with a narrow margin of safety. Therefore patients should be carefully supervised, since therapeutic response is unlikely to occur without some evidence of toxicity. Daily dose should not exceed 1 gram. Treatment should be discontinued promptly when one of the following signs of toxicity appears: Leucopenia (WBC under 3500/mm3). Thrombocytopenia (platelet under 100000/mm3). Stomatitis ( the first small ulceration at the inner margin of the lips is a signal for stopping treatment). Severe diarrhoea (frequent bowel movements and watery stools). Gastro-intestinal ulceration and bleeding.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Neonates
: No dosage recommendations are made for neonates.
Children
: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.
The elderly
: No special precautions are required, doses being adjusted for the patient's weight and height.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Cases of deliberate overdose are unknown but excessive toxicity because of the hematological effects as described above. There is no specific antidote to 5-5 FU PhaRes toxicity; treatment consists in supportive care. In addition to the hematological toxicity other toxicities will occur with overdose. Sign and symptoms are qualitatively similar to the side effects. Treatment should be performed promptly and appropriate drugs are given to control symptoms of overdose.
                    








Reconstitution





                            5-5 FU PhaRes is a cytotoxic anticancer drug and, caution should be exercised in handling 5-5 FU PhaRes. Special, trained personnel should reconstitute the drug. Preparation requires a room reserved for this purpose. The work surface should be covered with disposable plastic-backed absorbent paper. Smoking, eating and drinking are prohibited in the room. The handling staff must have a set of appropriate equipment, particularly long-sleeved coats, protective masks, caps, protective goggles, sterile disposable gloves, worktop protection sheets and waste collection containers and bags. If 5-5 FU PhaRes solution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. Following topical exposure, events have included tingling, burning and redness. If 5-5 FU PhaRes contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flashed thoroughly with water. Pregnant women must be warned and avoid handling cytotoxic agents. All broken containers must be treated with the same precautions and regarded as contaminated waste. Contaminated waste is to be disposed of by incineration in rigid containers labeled for this purpose or must be destroyed as per the government rules.
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Store the vial in original carton not exceeding 25℃. Do not refrigerate. Protect from light.

: Initial Dose: 12 mg/kg intravenously once daily for 4 successive days. Maximum Dose: 800 mg/day. If no toxicity is observed, 6 mg/kg may be administered on the 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th day (No therapy is given on days 5, 7, 9, or 11). Discontinue at the end of day 12, even with no apparent toxicity.
Poor risk patients and those who are not in an adequate nutritional state
: Initial Dose: 6 mg/kg/day for 3 days. Maximum Dose: 400 mg/day. If no toxicity is observed, 3 mg/kg may be administered on days 5, 7, and 9 (No therapy is to be administered on days 4, 6, or 8). Discontinue at the end of day 9, even with no apparent toxicity.
Maintenance therapy
: In instances where toxicity has not been a problem, it is recommended that therapy be continued using either of the following schedules:




Repeat the dosage of the first course every 30 days after the last day of the previous course, or


When the toxic signs resulting from the initial course of therapy have subsided, administer a maintenance dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg/week as a single dose. Maximum Dose: 1g/week .The reaction by the patient to the previous course of therapy should be taken into account and the dosage should be adjusted accordingly.




Usual adult dose for cervical cancer
: In combination with cisplatin 1 gm/m2 IV on day 1. The cycle is repeated every 21 days.
Usual pediatric dose for malignant disease
: The manufacturer has reported that the safety and effectiveness of fluorouracil have not been established in children. However, the drug has been used in children following adult guidelines.
Intra-arterial infusion
: Fluorouracil has also been given by intra-arterial infusion for adult in doses of 5 to 7.5 mg/kg body weight is dissolved in 20-100 ml of 5% Dextrose solution and administered 10-20 days by using an infusion pump.
Combination with radiation
: Usual adult daily dose of 5-10 mg/kg body weight is given in combination with radiation according to systemic administration method or intra-arterial infusion method.
Combination with other anticancer drugs
: Fluorouracil is used alone or in combination in the adjuvant treatment of breast and gastro-intestinal cancer, and palliation of inoperable malignant neoplasms, especially those of the gastro-intestinal tract, breast, head and neck, liver, genito-urinary system, and pancreas. It is also used with cyclophosphamide and methotrexate in the combination chemotherapy of breast cancer. A usual adult dose of 5 to 10 mg/kg body weight daily is given in combination with other anticancer drugs every day or intermittently once to twice a week by systemic administration method or intra-arterial infusion method.

Interaction





                            Pre-treatment with cimetidine for 4 weeks led to increased plasma concentrations of 5-Fluril following intravenous and oral administration in 6 patients. The effect was probably due to a combination of hepatic enzyme inhibition and reduced hepatic blood flow.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in patients that are severely debilitated or in patients with bone marrow suppression due to either radiotherapy or chemotherapy. It is likewise contraindicated in pregnant or breastfeeding women. It should also be avoided in patients that do not have malignant illnesses.
                    










Side Effects






Potentially life-threatening effects
: Severe effects from 5-5-Fluril are related to the dosage and duration of therapy.
Cardiac effects
: Occasional case reports associating 5-5-Fluril therapy with 'ischemic cardiac events' evidence against the autoimmune phenomenon is the fact that in several cases cardiotoxicity occurred within several hours of the first dose.
Hematological effects
: Potentially lethal effects caused by severe hematological toxicity may develop within the first 10 days of treatment being instituted but generally resolves within 3 weeks. At the recommended dose and schedule it is rather uncommon for hematological toxicity to be severe. Any ontribute to severe effects from 5-5-Fluril on the blood-forming cells. Thus extensive prior irradiation or the concomitant use of cytotoxic drugs tend to exacerbate the severity of the hematological side effects of 5-5-Fluril.
Neurological effects
: Effects on the central nervous system have been occasionally reported and cerebral ataxia is dose-dependent with an incidence of between 3.1 and 7%. Acute cerebellar syndromes and myelopathy have been described following intrathecal 5-5-Fluril. Neurological syndromes may occur rarely after carotid artery perfusion in head and neck cancer. Other effects Allergic reaction (including difficulty in breathing, closing of the throat, swelling of the lips, tongue, or face, or hives), decreased bone marrow function and blood problems (extreme fatigue, easy bruising or bleeding, black, bloody or tarry stools, or fever, chills, or signs of infection), hand-foot syndrome (tingling, pain, redness, swelling or tenderness of the hands and feet), severe vomiting, diarrhoea, frequent bowel movements or watery stools, or sores in the mouth or throat, or stomach pain or heartburn or black, bloody or tarry stools. Other less serious side effects may include mild to moderate nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite, balance problems, confusion, rash and itching, or temporary hair loss. Conjunctivitis, both acute and chronic can proceed to tear duct stenosis and ectropion following prolonged administration. Very chronic administration, extending beyond 3 months, of low dosage has been associated with low systemic toxicity but includes the possibility of painful and tender hands and feet associated with erythema of the extremities.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Fluorouracil is contraindicated throughout pregnancy. The literature pertaining to pregnancy and cytotoxic drugs is necessarily limited but it appears in general that risk of teratogenesis diminishes with the advancement of pregnancy. Therefore most cytotoxic drugs are absolutely contraindicated in the first trimester and 5-fluorouracil, used in the first trimester has been reported to cause multiple congenital abnormalities. There are many case reports, however, of pregnancy being conducted successfully with combination chemotherapy being given to the mother during the second and third trimesters. Because of the age of the population and the natural history of the tumors treated, most of the data on long-term follow-up pertain to therapy for leukemias. More data need to be accrued on the subsequent development of neonates before it is certain that any of these compounds are free of late effects.
It is not known whether fluorouracil is excreted in human milk. Because fluorouracil inhibits DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, mothers should not nurse while receiving this drug.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            5-5-Fluril is highly toxic drug with a narrow margin of safety. Therefore patients should be carefully supervised, since therapeutic response is unlikely to occur without some evidence of toxicity. Daily dose should not exceed 1 gram. Treatment should be discontinued promptly when one of the following signs of toxicity appears: Leucopenia (WBC under 3500/mm3). Thrombocytopenia (platelet under 100000/mm3). Stomatitis ( the first small ulceration at the inner margin of the lips is a signal for stopping treatment). Severe diarrhoea (frequent bowel movements and watery stools). Gastro-intestinal ulceration and bleeding.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Neonates
: No dosage recommendations are made for neonates.
Children
: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.
The elderly
: No special precautions are required, doses being adjusted for the patient's weight and height.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Cases of deliberate overdose are unknown but excessive toxicity because of the hematological effects as described above. There is no specific antidote to 5-5-Fluril toxicity; treatment consists in supportive care. In addition to the hematological toxicity other toxicities will occur with overdose. Sign and symptoms are qualitatively similar to the side effects. Treatment should be performed promptly and appropriate drugs are given to control symptoms of overdose.
                    








Reconstitution





                            5-5-Fluril is a cytotoxic anticancer drug and, caution should be exercised in handling 5-5-Fluril. Special, trained personnel should reconstitute the drug. Preparation requires a room reserved for this purpose. The work surface should be covered with disposable plastic-backed absorbent paper. Smoking, eating and drinking are prohibited in the room. The handling staff must have a set of appropriate equipment, particularly long-sleeved coats, protective masks, caps, protective goggles, sterile disposable gloves, worktop protection sheets and waste collection containers and bags. If 5-5-Fluril solution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. Following topical exposure, events have included tingling, burning and redness. If 5-5-Fluril contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flashed thoroughly with water. Pregnant women must be warned and avoid handling cytotoxic agents. All broken containers must be treated with the same precautions and regarded as contaminated waste. Contaminated waste is to be disposed of by incineration in rigid containers labeled for this purpose or must be destroyed as per the government rules.
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Store the vial in original carton not exceeding 25℃. Do not refrigerate. Protect from light.

Description





                            5X 30 mg tablet is an Emergency Contraceptive (EC) pill that prevents unwanted pregnancy. This is a Selective Progesterone Receptor Modulator (SPRM). 5X tablet is supplied for oral administration. The inactive ingredients are lactose monohydrate, povidone K-30, croscarmellose sodium and magnesium stearate.
                    




















Pharmacology





                            Ulipristal Acetate is an orally-active synthetic SPRM that acts via high-affinity binding to the human progesterone receptor. The primary mechanism of action is inhibition or delay of ovulation. Data shows that even when taken immediately before ovulation is scheduled to occur, Ulipristal Acetate is able to postpone follicular rupture in some women.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            One 30 mg tablet must be taken as soon as possible but no later than 120 hours of unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure, with or without food. If vomiting occurs within 3 hours of intake, then another tablet needed to be taken. Ulipristal Acetate can be taken at any time of menstrual cycle.

Interaction





                            5X interacts with the following drugs: Barbiturates, Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, Rifampicin, Itraconazole, Ketoconazole etc.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Ulipristal Acetate is contraindicated in case of hypersensitivity to active substances and in pregnancy.
                    










Side Effects





                            Most common side-effects are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea, fatigue, dizziness, breast tenderness etc.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Contraindicated in suspected or existing pregnancy. Ulipristal Acetate excretes in breast milk. So breastfeeding is not recommended for one week after intake. Extremely limited data are available on the health of the fetus/newborn exposed to Ulipristal acetate.
                    








Precautions & Warnings






Existing Pregnancy
: 5X is not indicated for termination of an existing pregnancy.
Ectopic Pregnancy
: A history of ectopic pregnancy is not a contraindication to the use of this emergency contraceptive method.
Repeated Use
: 5X is for occasional use as an emergency contraceptive. It should not replace a regular method of contraception. Repeated use of 5X within the same menstrual cycle is not recommended, as safety and efficacy of repeat use within the same cycle has not been evaluated.
Fertility Following Use
: A rapid return of fertility is likely following treatment with 5X for emergency contraception. So, to prevent pregnancy on a later episode of sexual intercourse one should use the barrier method (ex. Condom).
Effect on Menstrual Cycle
: After 5X intake, menses sometimes occur earlier or later than expected by a few days. In clinical trials, cycle length was increased by a mean of 2.5 days but returned to normal in the subsequent cycle. 7% of subjects reported menses occurring more than 7 days earlier than expected, and 19% reported a delay of more than 7 days. If there is a delay in the onset of expected menses beyond 1 week, a pregnancy test should be performed. 9% of women studied reported intermenstrual bleeding after the use of 5X.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Children and Adolescents
: Limited safety and efficacy data available on women under 18 years old. 
Hepatic Impairment
: No studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic disease on the disposition of 5X.
Renal Impairment
: No studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal disease on the disposition of 5X.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Experience with 5X overdose is limited, in a clinical study, a single dose equivalent to four times 5X was administered to a limited number of subjects without any adverse reactions.

Indications





                            A-B1 is specifically used in the treatment of the various manifestations of thiamine deficiency such as Beriberi and Wernick's encephalopathy, neuritis associated with pregnancy and pellagra. Supplementary A-B1 may be indicated prophylactically in conditions where there is low dietary intake or impaired gastro intestinal absorption of thiamine (e.g. alcohol) or where requirements are increased (pregnancy, carbohydrate rich diet).

Pharmacology





                            Thiamine, in the form of thiamine pyrophosphate, is the coenzyme for decarboxylation of α-ketoglutaric acid. Thiamine deficiency affects the peripheral nervous system, the gastrointestinal tract, and the cardiovascular system. This vitamin is necessary for the optimal growth of infants and children. Thiamine is not stored in the body, and is regularly lost from tissues during short periods of deficiency. In order to maintain normal health, an adequate amount of thiamine is required every day. Deficiency of thiamine leads to fatigue, anorexia, gastrointestinal disturbance, tachycardia, irritability and neurological symptoms. Beriberi, a disease due to vitamin B1 deficiency, is common in alcoholics, in pregnant women receiving an inadequate diet, and in people with malabsorption syndrome, prolonged diarrhoea and hepatic disease.
Thiamine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and widely distributed throughout the body. Thiamine is rapidly absorbed from the upper small intestine. Thiamine is not stored in the body to any appreciable extent. Excess ingested thiamine appears in urine as intact thiamine or as pyrimidine, which arises from degradation of the thiamine molecule. The plasma half life of thiamine is 24 hours.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Prophylaxis
: 3 to 10 mg daily.
Mild chronic deficiency
: 10 to 25 mg daily.
Severe deficiency
: 200 to 300 mg daily.
                    




* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন
'




















Interaction





                            No hazardous drug interactions have been reported. Vitamin B1 acts synergistically with other vitamins of the B-complex group and its potential for causing adverse effects is considerably reduced.
                    




















Contraindications





                            There is no absolute contraindication but the risk of anaphylaxis is increased by repeated parenteral administration. Mild allergic phenomena, such as sneezing or mild asthma are warning signs that further may give rise to anaphylactic shock. To avoid this possibility it is advisable to start a second course of injection with a dose considerably lower than that previously used. Because of the above, vitamin B1 injection should not be given intravenously except in the case of comatose patients. Once thiamine deficiency is corrected there is no need for parenteral administration or for the administration of amounts in excess of daily requirement.
                    










Side Effects





                            Vitamin B1 does not have adverse effects when given orally, but in a few fatal cases anaphylactic reactions have occurred after intravenous administration of large doses (400 mg) in sensitive patients, especially children, and in one case following an intramuscular dose of 125 mg. The risk of such reactions increases with repeated administration of the drug by parenteral route. Transient mild soreness may occur at the site of intramuscular administration
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            The drug may be given safely to neonates, children, pregnant and lactating women and elderly patients.

Storage Conditions





                            A-B1 injection should be protected from light and moisture.

250 mg or 500 mg tablet
: A-Cal is used for the treatment or prevention of calcium depletion in patients in whom dietary measures are inadequate. Conditions that may be associated with calcium deficiency include hypoparathyroidism, achlorhydria, chronic diarrhea, vitamin D deficiency, steatorrhea, sprue, pregnancy and lactation, menopause, pancreatitis, renal failure, alkalosis, and hyperphosphataemia. Calcium Carbonate is being used increasingly often to treat hyperphosphataemia in chronic renal failure as well as those on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and haemodialysis. Many patients are unable to tolerate sufficient doses for complete phosphate control and require additional measures such as stringent dietary phosphate restriction or relatively small doses of aluminium hydroxide. Calcium Carbonate containing preparations can provide short-term relief of dyspeptic systems but are no longer recommended for long-term treatment of peptic ulceration.
1000 mg tablet
: A-Cal is indicated for the management of conditions associated with hyperidity and for fast relief of acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach and upset stomach.

Pharmacology





                            Calcium carbonate reacts with gastric acid to produce a salt and water. For calcium carbonate the postulated chemical reaction is: CaCO
3
+2HCl = CaCl
2
+H
2
O+CO
2
. Two grams of calcium carbonate will readily bring 100 ml of hydrochloric acid to a pH above 6. The increase in gastric pH diminishes the activity of pepsin in the gastric secretion. Up to 30% of the oral calcium load may be absorbed.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






250 mg or 500 mg tablet
: Calcium Carbonate is always used orally and when used as an antacid the recommended doses for adults are equivalent to 540-2000 mg Calcium Carbonate per day, doses for children being half of those for adults. As a dietary supplement, such as for the prevention of osteoporosis, 1250-3750 mg Calcium Carbonate (500-1500 mg calcium) daily is recommended in general, but again this will need to be tailored to the individual patient depending on any specific disease such as Calcium deficiency, malabsorption or parathyroid function. In pregnancy and lactation the recommended daily dose of calcium is 1200-1500 mg. In chronic renal failure the doses used vary from 2.5-9.0 gm Calcium Carbonate per day and need to be adjusted according to the individual patient. To maximize effective phosphate binding in this context the Calcium Carbonate should be given with meals.
1000 mg tablet
: 2000-3000 mg tablet when symptoms occur; may be repeated hourly if needed or as directed by the physician.

Interaction





                            Calcium Carbonate may enhance the cardiac effects of digoxin and other cardiac glycosides, if systemic hypercalcaemia occurs. Calcium Carbonate may interfere with the absorption of concomitantly administered tetracycline preparations and in chronic renal failure modification of vitamin D therapy may be required to avoid hypercalcaemia when Calcium Carbonate is used as the primary phosphate binder.
                    




















Contraindications








Hypercalcaemia and hyperparathyroidism


Hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis


Zollinger-Ellison syndrome


Concomitant digoxin therapy (requires careful monitoring of serum calcium level)



When hypercalcaemia occurs, discontinuation of the drug is usually sufficient to return serum calcium concentrations to normal. Calcium salts should be used cautiously in patients with sarcoidosis, renal or cardiac disease, and in patients receiving cardiac glycosides.
                    










Side Effects





                            Orally administered Calcium Carbonate may be irritating to the GI tract. It may also cause constipation. Hypercalcaemia is rarely produced by administration of calcium alone, but may occur when large doses are given to patients with chronic renal failure.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Calcium containing drugs have been widely used in pregnancy by way of oral calcium supplementation or antacid therapy. Calcium Carbonate can be used in lactating women too.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Use in children
: Calcium carbonate has been extensively studied in children and infants with chronic renal failure and is both safe and effective.
Use in elderly
: In case of elderly patients with renal failure when calcium carbonate is taken constipation may be troublesome one for this group. For this reason, monitoring of serum calcium and phosphate is of course indicated for elderly patients.

Pharmacology





                            Isosorbide mononitrate is the major active metabolite of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), and most of the clinical activity of the dinitrate is attributable to the mononitrate. The principal pharmacological action of isosorbide mononitrate is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and  pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction and coronary dilatation remains undefined.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Tablet
: The usual oral dose is 1 tablet (20 mg) 2 times daily, first dose in the morning and another 7 hours apart. Although maintenance doses ranging from 20 mg to 120 mg (1-6 tablets), a dose of 10 mg (1/2 tablet) is suitable when lower dosage is used at the starting of treatment or as directed by a registered physician.
Sustained Release Capsule
: The usual oral dose is 1 capsule (50 mg) daily or as directed by the registered physician.

Interaction








Concomitant use of A-Card with phosphodiesterase inhibitors in any form is contraindicated.


Concomitant use of A-Card with riociguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, is contraindicated.


The vasodilating effects of A-Card may be additive with those of other vasodilators. Alcohol, in particular, has been found to exhibit additive effects of this variety.


Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used in combination. Dose adjustments of either class of agents may be necessary.
























Contraindications





                            Isosorbide mononitrate is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to it. Do not use Isosorbide Mononitrate in patients who are taking certain drugs for erectile dysfunction (phosphodiesterase inhibitors), such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil. Concomitant use can cause severe hypotension, syncope, or myocardial ischemia. Do not use Isosorbide Mononitrate in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat. Concomitant use can cause hypotension.
                    










Side Effects





                            Headache, feelings of dizziness, hypotension may occur sometimes.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy Category B: Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits at doses of up to 540 and 810 mg/kg/day, respectively, have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to isosorbide mononitrate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Isosorbide Mononitrate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.
Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether isosorbide mononitrate is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when isosorbide mononitrate is administered to a nursing woman.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with even small doses of A-Card. A-Card should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by A-Card may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. 
Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of oral A-Card is not known.
Patients should be told that the antianginal efficacy of A-Card tablets can be maintained by carefully following the prescribed schedule of dosing (two doses taken seven hours apart). For most patients, this can be accomplished by taking the first dose on awakening and the second dose 7 hours later.
As with other nitrates, daily headaches sometimes accompany treatment with A-Card. In patients who get these headaches, the headaches are a marker of the activity of the drug. Patients should resist the temptation to avoid headaches by altering the schedule of their treatment with A-Card, since loss of headache may be associated with simultaneous loss of antianginal efficacy. Aspirin and/or acetaminophen, on the other hand, often successfully relieve A-Card-induced headaches with no deleterious effect on A-Card’s antianginal efficacy.
Treatment with A-Card may be associated with light-headedness on standing, especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol.
                    








Overdose Effects






Symptoms
: Most common symptoms are hypotension, throbbing headache, tachycardia, and flushing. Methemoglobinemia may occur with massive doses.
Treatment
: Treatment consists of placing patients in recumbent position and administering fluids; alpha-adrenergic vasopressors may be required. Methemoglobinemia should be treated with methyline blue at a dose of 1-2 mg/kg IV slowly.

Antioxidant vitamins are used in a wide range of conditions where free radical damage is playing a role. Antioxidant vitamin combination is used in the prevention of coronary heart diseases, certain types of cancer, aging as well as free radical damage caused by excessive exercise, illness, certain medications, air pollution, smoke, radiation and pesticides. The main role of the antioxidant vitamins is as follows:
β carotene prevents free radical formation by quenching singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of oxygen. Vitamin C is another free radical scavenger which deactivates free radicals. It works specially in the plasma, lung fluid, aqueous humour and interstitial fluid. It can increase white blood cell activity; play important roles in the biochemistry of antibodies, prostaglandin E 1 , B and T lymphocytes, and interferon. Vitamin E also scavenges free radicals in the blood along with β carotene and vitamin C. Moreover, vitamin E is essential to protect against some of the ill effects of smog and smoke. In relation to other nutrients vitamin E protects vitamin A from being destroyed in the body.

Pharmacology






Beta carotene
 of this tablet is converted to vitamin A (Retinol) when required. Retinol has several biochemical functions e.g. on retina, growth, tissue differentiation, immunological response. It has also some anti-cancer activity.
Vitamin C
 is the most powerful reducing agent known to be present in living tissues. Vitamin C deficiency produces scurvy. It is a cofactor in numerous biological processes. Vitamin C and molecular oxygen are essential for the conversion of proline to hydroxyproline, dopamine to noradrenaline . Vitamin C is also essential for the synthesis of adrenal steroid hormones. Vitamin C is important in the defense against infection and studies shown that vitamin C is important for the normal functioning of T-lymphocyte and leukocyte. Ascorbic acid has some antiinflammatory activity and protects cells against oxidation of essential molecules. In high doses, (1-2 g daily) ascorbic acid increases iron absorption.
vitamin E
 seems to be as a defense against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In most cell membranes there is one molecule of tocopherol for every 1000 lipid molecules. Tocopherol mops up peroxide radicals and then needs a supply of reduced hydrogen to restore the steady-state situation. This is usually supplied by ascorbic acid or reduced glutathione.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            This tablet is administered orally. The adult dose of this combination of antioxidant vitamin tablet is 1 tablet daily or as prescribed by the physician.

Interaction





                            Cholestyramine, Colestipol, Neomycin cause decreased absorption of β carotene. Circulating vitamin C levels have been shown to be reduced during prolonged administration of oral contraceptives containing Oestrogen, Tetracycline and Aspirin. The decrease in vitamin C level may be due to drug induced impaired absorption or increased utilization of the vitamin for drug metabolism. Vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of anticoagulant drugs. High doses of vitamin E can impair intestinal absorption of vitamins A and K.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Carocet is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components.
                    










Side Effects






β carotene
 is comparatively safe even at high and prolonged exposure. Individuals who routinely ingest large amounts of carotenoids can develop hypercarotenosis, which is characterised by a yellowish colouration of the skin and a very high concentration of carotenoids in the plasma. This benign condition, although resembling jaundice, gradually disappears upon correcting the excessive intake of carotenoids.
Vitamin C
 is generally a safe drug for human use in normal doses. Larger doses may lead to gastrointestinal tract upset and renal stone formation.
Vitamin E
 is considered safe even in large doses. Doses over 800 mg may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain or cramps, fatigue and reduced resistance to bacterial infection and transiently raised blood pressure.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            β carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E have no teratogenic effects in humans. However, like any other drugs caution should be taken in prescribing to pregnant women.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            There are some evidences that β carotene may cause harm to heavy smokers and alcoholics. Therefore, caution should be exercised in these cases. Vitamin C should be given with caution to patients with hyperoxaluria. Vitamin E should be used with caution in patients taking anticoagulant drugs, because vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of these drugs.

Composition





                            Each 5 ml syrup contains-




Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide BP 20 mg


Phenylephrine Hydrochloride BP 10 mg


Triprolidine Hydrochloride BP 2.5 mg




































Pharmacology





                            This preparation is a mixture of antitussive, decongestant and antihistamine agent. Dextromethorphan is a safe, effective, non-narcotic antitussive agent which has a central action on the cough centre in the medulla. Although structurally related to Morphine, it has no analgesic and habit forming properties and in general it has little sedative activity. Phenylephrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passage. Phenylephrine is used for the temporary relief of stuffy nose, sinus, and ear symptoms caused by the common cold, flu, allergies, sinusitis & bronchitis. This medication works by decreasing swelling in the nose and ears, thereby lessening discomfort and making it easier to breathe. Triprolidine is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergy, hay fever, and the common cold. These symptoms include rash, watery eyes, itchy eyes/nose/throat/skin, cough, runny nose, and sneezing. It is a potent competitive histamine H1-receptor antagonist of the pyrrolidine class with mild central nervous system depressant properties which may cause drowsiness. By antagonizing another natural substance acetylcholine, it helps dry up some body fluids to relieve symptoms such as watery eyes and runny nose.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adults & Children over 12 years
: 1 teaspoonful (5 ml) 4 times a day every 4 hours interval.
6-12 years
: 1/2 teaspoonful 4 times a day every 4 hours interval.
Use in children and adolescents
: A physician's advice should be obtained before administering this combination to children less than 6 years.

Pharmacology





                            Bromhexine Hydrochloride is an oral mucolytic agent. It disrupts the structure of acid mucopolysaccharide fibres in mucoid sputum and produces less viscous mucus, which makes easier the expectoration. It is rapidly & completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is widely distributed into the body tissues.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            The recommended doses for adults and children are stated below:




Adult & Children over 12 years: 10 ml (2 teaspoons) 3 times daily


Children 6-12 years: 5 ml (1 teaspoon) 3 times daily


Children 2-6 years: 2.5 ml (1/2 teaspoon) 3 times daily


Bromhexine Hydrochloride is not recommended for children under 2 years of age without advice.

Interaction





                            There are no known significant interactions with other drugs.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Bromhexine Hydrochloride or any of the ingredients of this product.
                    










Side Effects





                            Gastrointestinal side effects may occur occasionally. A transient rise in serum aminotransferase values has been reported. Other reported side effects include-headache, vertigo (dizziness) and allergic reactions.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation






Use in Pregnancy
: Special care is recommended during pregnancy. The benefits of bromhexine must be assessed against possible effects on children.
Use in Lactation
: Bromhexine is expected to enter breast milk. Therefore it is not recommended that bromhexine be taken by lactating mothers.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Since mucolytics may disrupt the gastric mucosa bromhexine should be used with care in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease. Care is also advisable in asthmatic patients. Clearance of bromhexine and its metabolites may be reduced in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Cough expectorants & mucolytics
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Keep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of reach of children.

Pharmacology





                            Dilofenac Sodium is a potent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with pronounced anti-rheumatic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. It has also some uricosuric effect. Diclofenac exerts its effect by inhibiting prostaglandin biosynthesis which plays a major role in causing inflammation, pain and fever. Diclofenac is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract when taken with or after meal. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within an average of 2 hours after ingestion of it. At therapeutic concentrations, it is 99.7% bound to plasma proteins. Diclofenac is metabolized in the liver and undergoes first pass metabolism.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Diclofenac FC Tablet
: Adults: 75-150 mg daily in 2 to 3 divided doses, preferably after food. Dose should be reduced in long term use. 
Diclofenac SR Tablet
: 




Adult
: 1 tablet daily, taken whole with liquid, preferably at meal times. If necessary, the daily dose can be increased to 150 mg by supplementation with conventional tablets.


Children
: 1-3 mg of diclofenac/kg body wt. daily in divided doses.


Elderly patients
: In elderly or debilitated patients, the lowest effective dosage is recommended, although the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium is not impaired to any clinically relevant extent in elderly patients.




Diclofenac Dispersible Tablet
:




Adults
: The recommended daily dosage is 2-3 tablets and the maximum daily dose is 150 mg. In milder cases, 2 tablets of Diclofenac DT per day are sufficient. Diclofenac DT should preferably be taken before meals.


Children
: Diclofenac is not recommended in children for other indications except juvenile rheumatoid arthritis where the recommended dose is 1-3 mg/kg body weight. Diclofenac DT is to be dropped into a half-glass of water and the liquid is to be stirred to aid dispersion before swallowing. There is no information on the use of Diclofenac DT for more than 03 months.




Diclofenac TR Capsule
: One capsule daily. Diclofenac TR should be taken preferably after mealtimes.
Diclofenac Suppository
: For adults: 50 mg suppository 2-3 times daily. Maximum daily dose is 150 mg.
Diclofenac injection
: For adults the usual dose is 1 ampoule daily. In serious cases this dose may be increased up to 2 ampoules daily.
Diclofenac Gel
: For external use only. Depending on the size of area to be treated, 2-4 g of Diclofenac gel should be applied to the skin 3-4 times daily. To the affected area gel should be rubbed in lightly. This gel may also be given in addition to further treatment with other dosage forms of Diclofenac.

Interaction





                            A-Fenac may have the following drug interactions:
Lithium and digoxin
: A-Fenac may increase plasma concentrations of lithium and digoxin.
Anticoagulants
: There are isolated reports of an increased risk of haemorrhage with the combined use of diclofenac and anticoagulant therapy, although clinical investigations do not appear to indicate any influence on anticoagulant effect.
Antidiabetic agents
: Clinical studies have shown that diclofenac can be given together with oral antidiabetic agents without influencing their clinical effect.
Cyclosporin
: Cases of nephrotoxicity have been reported in patients receiving cyclosporin and diclofenac concomitantly.
Methotrexate
: Cases of serious toxicity have been reported when methotrexate and NSAIDs are given within 24 hours of each other.
Quinolone antimicrobials
: Convulsions may occur due to an interaction between quinolones and NSAIDs. 
Therefore, caution should be exercised when considering concomitant therapy of NSAID and quinolones.
Other NSAIDs and steroids
: Co-administration of diclofenac with other systemic NSAIDs and steroids may increase the frequency of unwanted effects. With aspirin, the plasma levels of each is lowered, although no clinical significance is known.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Contraindicated to the patients hypersensitive to any ingredient of the products. Peptic ulcer, hypersensitivity to Diclofenac like other non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents, Diclofenac is also contra-indicated in asthmatic patient in whom attack with asthma, urticaria or acute rhinitis are precipitated by acetylsalicylic acid or by other drugs with prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor. This Gel should not be used under occlusive airtight dressings.
                    










Side Effects





                            A-Fenac is generally well tolerated. Adverse effects are mild, rare and transient. At the starting of the treatment, however, patients may be sometimes complaining of epigastric pain, eructation, nausea and diarrhea or dizziness or headache. These effects are usually mild in nature. Peripheral edema and skin reactions, such as rash and eczema have also been encountered. A-Fenac Gel may cause local irritation and reddening of the skin and skin rash.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            During pregnancy, Diclofenac should be employed only for compelling reasons. The lowest effective dose should be used. These types of drugs are not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy. In view of insufficient clinical data, Diclofenac Sodium Gel is not recommended during pregnancy. A very insignificant quantity of Diclofenac may be detected in breast milk but no undesirable effects on the infant to be expected.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            In rare instances where peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding occurs in patients under treatment with A-Fenac. In patients with advanced age should be kept under close observation. A-Fenac Gel should not be allowed to come in contact with the eyes or mucus membranes, after application the hands should be washed properly and not to be taken by mouth.

Interaction





                            A-Fenac may have the following drug interactions:
Lithium and digoxin
: A-Fenac may increase plasma concentrations of lithium and digoxin.
Anticoagulants
: There are isolated reports of an increased risk of haemorrhage with the combined use of diclofenac and anticoagulant therapy, although clinical investigations do not appear to indicate any influence on anticoagulant effect.
Antidiabetic agents
: Clinical studies have shown that diclofenac can be given together with oral antidiabetic agents without influencing their clinical effect.
Cyclosporin
: Cases of nephrotoxicity have been reported in patients receiving cyclosporin and diclofenac concomitantly.
Methotrexate
: Cases of serious toxicity have been reported when methotrexate and NSAIDs are given within 24 hours of each other.
Quinolone antimicrobials
: Convulsions may occur due to an interaction between quinolones and NSAIDs. 
Therefore, caution should be exercised when considering concomitant therapy of NSAID and quinolones.
Other NSAIDs and steroids
: Co-administration of diclofenac with other systemic NSAIDs and steroids may increase the frequency of unwanted effects. With aspirin, the plasma levels of each is lowered, although no clinical significance is known.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Contraindicated to the patients hypersensitive to any ingredient of the products. Peptic ulcer, hypersensitivity to Diclofenac like other non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents, Diclofenac is also contra-indicated in asthmatic patient in whom attack with asthma, urticaria or acute rhinitis are precipitated by acetylsalicylic acid or by other drugs with prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor. This Gel should not be used under occlusive airtight dressings.
                    










Side Effects





                            A-Fenac is generally well tolerated. Adverse effects are mild, rare and transient. At the starting of the treatment, however, patients may be sometimes complaining of epigastric pain, eructation, nausea and diarrhea or dizziness or headache. These effects are usually mild in nature. Peripheral edema and skin reactions, such as rash and eczema have also been encountered. A-Fenac Gel may cause local irritation and reddening of the skin and skin rash.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            During pregnancy, Diclofenac should be employed only for compelling reasons. The lowest effective dose should be used. These types of drugs are not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy. In view of insufficient clinical data, Diclofenac Sodium Gel is not recommended during pregnancy. A very insignificant quantity of Diclofenac may be detected in breast milk but no undesirable effects on the infant to be expected.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            In rare instances where peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding occurs in patients under treatment with A-Fenac. In patients with advanced age should be kept under close observation. A-Fenac Gel should not be allowed to come in contact with the eyes or mucus membranes, after application the hands should be washed properly and not to be taken by mouth.

Pharmacology





                            Dilofenac Sodium is a potent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with pronounced anti-rheumatic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. It has also some uricosuric effect. Diclofenac exerts its effect by inhibiting prostaglandin biosynthesis which plays a major role in causing inflammation, pain and fever. Diclofenac is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract when taken with or after meal. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within an average of 2 hours after ingestion of it. At therapeutic concentrations, it is 99.7% bound to plasma proteins. Diclofenac is metabolized in the liver and undergoes first pass metabolism.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Diclofenac FC Tablet
: Adults: 75-150 mg daily in 2 to 3 divided doses, preferably after food. Dose should be reduced in long term use. 
Diclofenac SR Tablet
: 




Adult
: 1 tablet daily, taken whole with liquid, preferably at meal times. If necessary, the daily dose can be increased to 150 mg by supplementation with conventional tablets.


Children
: 1-3 mg of diclofenac/kg body wt. daily in divided doses.


Elderly patients
: In elderly or debilitated patients, the lowest effective dosage is recommended, although the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium is not impaired to any clinically relevant extent in elderly patients.




Diclofenac Dispersible Tablet
:




Adults
: The recommended daily dosage is 2-3 tablets and the maximum daily dose is 150 mg. In milder cases, 2 tablets of Diclofenac DT per day are sufficient. Diclofenac DT should preferably be taken before meals.


Children
: Diclofenac is not recommended in children for other indications except juvenile rheumatoid arthritis where the recommended dose is 1-3 mg/kg body weight. Diclofenac DT is to be dropped into a half-glass of water and the liquid is to be stirred to aid dispersion before swallowing. There is no information on the use of Diclofenac DT for more than 03 months.




Diclofenac TR Capsule
: One capsule daily. Diclofenac TR should be taken preferably after mealtimes.
Diclofenac Suppository
: For adults: 50 mg suppository 2-3 times daily. Maximum daily dose is 150 mg.
Diclofenac injection

Side Effects





                            A-Fenac is generally well tolerated. Adverse effects are mild, rare and transient. At the starting of the treatment, however, patients may be sometimes complaining of epigastric pain, eructation, nausea and diarrhea or dizziness or headache. These effects are usually mild in nature. Peripheral edema and skin reactions, such as rash and eczema have also been encountered. A-Fenac Gel may cause local irritation and reddening of the skin and skin rash.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            During pregnancy, Diclofenac should be employed only for compelling reasons. The lowest effective dose should be used. These types of drugs are not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy. In view of insufficient clinical data, Diclofenac Sodium Gel is not recommended during pregnancy. A very insignificant quantity of Diclofenac may be detected in breast milk but no undesirable effects on the infant to be expected.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            In rare instances where peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding occurs in patients under treatment with A-Fenac.

Pharmacology





                            Dilofenac Sodium is a potent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with pronounced anti-rheumatic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. It has also some uricosuric effect. Diclofenac exerts its effect by inhibiting prostaglandin biosynthesis which plays a major role in causing inflammation, pain and fever. Diclofenac is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract when taken with or after meal. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within an average of 2 hours after ingestion of it. At therapeutic concentrations, it is 99.7% bound to plasma proteins. Diclofenac is metabolized in the liver and undergoes first pass metabolism.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Diclofenac FC Tablet
: Adults: 75-150 mg daily in 2 to 3 divided doses, preferably after food. Dose should be reduced in long term use. 
Diclofenac SR Tablet
: 




Adult
: 1 tablet daily, taken whole with liquid, preferably at meal times. If necessary, the daily dose can be increased to 150 mg by supplementation with conventional tablets.


Children
: 1-3 mg of diclofenac/kg body wt. daily in divided doses.


Elderly patients
: In elderly or debilitated patients, the lowest effective dosage is recommended, although the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium is not impaired to any clinically relevant extent in elderly patients.




Diclofenac Dispersible Tablet
:




Adults
: The recommended daily dosage is 2-3 tablets and the maximum daily dose is 150 mg. In milder cases, 2 tablets of Diclofenac DT per day are sufficient. Diclofenac DT should preferably be taken before meals.


Children
: Diclofenac is not recommended in children for other indications except juvenile rheumatoid arthritis where the recommended dose is 1-3 mg/kg body weight. Diclofenac DT is to be dropped into a half-glass of water and the liquid is to be stirred to aid dispersion before swallowing. There is no information on the use of Diclofenac DT for more than 03 months.




Diclofenac TR Capsule
: One capsule daily. Diclofenac TR should be taken preferably after mealtimes.
Diclofenac Suppository
: For adults: 50 mg suppository 2-3 times daily. Maximum daily dose is 150 mg.
Diclofenac injection
: For adults the usual dose is 1 ampoule daily. In serious cases this dose may be increased up to 2 ampoules daily.
Diclofenac Gel
: For external use only. Depending on the size of area to be treated, 2-4 g of Diclofenac gel should be applied to the skin 3-4 times daily. To the affected area gel should be rubbed in lightly. This gel may also be given in addition to further treatment with other dosage forms of Diclofenac.

Interaction





                            A-Fenac may have the following drug interactions:
Lithium and digoxin
: A-Fenac may increase plasma concentrations of lithium and digoxin.
Anticoagulants
: There are isolated reports of an increased risk of haemorrhage with the combined use of diclofenac and anticoagulant therapy, although clinical investigations do not appear to indicate any influence on anticoagulant effect.
Antidiabetic agents
: Clinical studies have shown that diclofenac can be given together with oral antidiabetic agents without influencing their clinical effect.
Cyclosporin
: Cases of nephrotoxicity have been reported in patients receiving cyclosporin and diclofenac concomitantly.
Methotrexate
: Cases of serious toxicity have been reported when methotrexate and NSAIDs are given within 24 hours of each other.
Quinolone antimicrobials
: Convulsions may occur due to an interaction between quinolones and NSAIDs. 
Therefore, caution should be exercised when considering concomitant therapy of NSAID and quinolones.
Other NSAIDs and steroids
: Co-administration of diclofenac with other systemic NSAIDs and steroids may increase the frequency of unwanted effects. With aspirin, the plasma levels of each is lowered, although no clinical significance is known.

Pharmacology





                            The mechanism of action of Diclofenac Potassium, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).
Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adults
: Following an initial loading dose of 50 mg, 25-50 mg is to be taken every eight hours if necessary.
Migraine
: An initial loading dose of 50 mg, then if necessary a further 25-50 mg after 2 hours. The maximum daily dose is 150 mg. The tablets should be swallowed whole with liquid, preferably before meals.
Children
: Children over 14 years of age: upto 75 mg daily in divided doses.

Anticoagulant:There are isolated reports of and increased risk of haemorrhage with the combined use of A-Fenac K and anticoagulant therapy.


Cyclosporin: Cases of nephrotoxicity have been reported in patients receiving Cyclosporin and A-Fenac K concomitantly.


Methotrexate: Cases of serious toxicity have been reported when Methotrexate and NSAIDs are given within 24 hours of each other.


Diuretics: Like other NSAIDs, A-Fenac K may inhibit the activity of diuretics.


Other NSAIDs and steroids; Co-administration of A-Fenac K with other systemic NSAIDs and steroids may increase the frequency of unwanted effects.
























Contraindications





                            Diclofenac Potassium tablets are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Diclofenac. Diclofenac should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic-like reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients. Diclofenac is contraindicated for the treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side-effects of A-Fenac K are usually mild and transient. However, if serious side-effects occur. A-Fenac K should be discontinued. Occasional: epigastric pain, other gastro-intestinal disorders (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, dyspepsia,flatulence,anorexia). Rare: gastro-intestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer (with or without bleeding or perforation), bloody diarrhoea.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Diclofenac should not be prescribed during pregnancy, unless there are compelling reasons for doing so. The lowest effective dosage should be used. This type of drugs are not recommended during the last trimester of pregnancy. Very small quantities of diclofenac may be detected in breast milk, but no undesirable effects on the infant are to be expected.

Pharmacology





                            Diclofenac Sodium is a potent nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) with marked analgesic and antipyretic properties. It also has some uricosuric effects. The action of Diclofenac appeared to be associated with the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Diclofenac may inhibit synthesis of prostaglandins by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, an enzyme that catalyses the formation of prostaglandin precursors from arachidonic acid. Peak plasma concentration is achieved within half an hour following injection. Lidocaine is the most widely used local anaesthetic drug. It acts more rapidly and is more stable than most other local anaesthetics. It is a very useful surface anaesthetic. Like other local anaesthetics, Lidocaine impairs the generation and conduction of nerve impulses by slowing depolarization. The onset of anaesthesia of Lidocaine Hydrochloride is more rapid and the duration is 1-2 hours.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adult
: One ampoule once (or in severe cases, twice) daily by intramuscular injection.
Renal colic
: One ampoule once daily intramuscularly. A second dose may be administered after 30 minutes if necessary.
Children
: In Juvenile chronic arthritis, 1-3 mg of Diclofenac Sodium per kg body weight daily in divided doses.
Elderly patients
: In elderly or debilitated patients, the lowest effective dosage is recommended, commensurate with age and physical status, or as prescribed by the physician.

Interaction






Lithium and Digoxin:
 Diclofenac may increase plasma concentrations of Lithium and Digoxin. 
Anticoagulants:
 There are isolated reports of an increased risk of haemorrhage with the combined use of Diclofenac and anticoagulant therapy, although clinical investigations do not appear to indicate any influence on anticoagulant effect. 
Antidiabetic agents: 
Clinical studies have shown that Diclofenac can be given together with oral antidiabetic agents without influencing their clinical effect. 
Cyclosporin: 
Cases of nephrotoxicity have been reported in patients receiving Cyclosporin and Diclofenac concomitantly. 
Methotrexate: 
Cases of serious toxicity have been reported when Methotrexate and NSAIDs are given within 24 hours of each other. 
Quinolone antimicrobials:
 Convulsions may occur due to an interaction between quinolones and NSAIDs. Therefore, caution should be exercised when considering concomitant therapy of NSAIDs and quinolones. 
Other NSAIDs and steroids
: Co-administration of Diclofenac with other systemic NSAIDs and steroids may increase the frequency of unwanted effects. With Aspirin, the plasma levels of each are lowered, although no clinical significance is known. 
Diuretics:
 Various NSAIDs are liable to inhibit the activity of diuretics. Concomitant treatment with potassium-sparing diuretics may be associated with increased serum potassium levels. So, serum potassium should be monitored.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated for those patients who are hypersensitive to Diclofenac. In patients with active or suspected peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding or for those patients in whom attacks of asthma, urticaria or acute rhinitis are precipitated by Aspirin or other NSAIDs possessing prostaglandin synthetase inhibiting activity Diclofenac is also contraindicated. Because of the presence of Lidocaine, this injection is also contraindicated for those patients who are hypersensitive to local anaesthetics of the amide type, although the incidence is very rare. In patients with Adams-Stokes syndrome or with severe degrees of SA, AV, or intraventricular heart block in the absence of an artificial pacemaker, and for those patients who are hypersensitive to any of the excipients used in the formulation (Sodium Metabisulphite, Disodium Edetate, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol), this injection is also contraindicated.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects to Diclofenac Sodium and Lidocaine injection are usually mild and transient. However if serious side effects occur the injection should be discontinued. Gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, diarrhea and occasionally bleeding may occur. In very rare instances, injection site disorder may occur. In isolated cases, abscesses and local necrosis may occur. The adverse effects due to Lidocaine mainly involve the CNS, are usually of short duration, and are dose related. The CNS reactions may be manifested by drowsiness, dizziness, disorientation, confusion, lightheadedness etc.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            It should not be prescribed during pregnancy unless there are compelling reasons for doing so. The lowest effective dosage should be used. These types of drugs are not recommended during the last trimester of pregnancy. Very small quantities of Diclofenac may be detected in breast milk, but no undesirable effects on the infant are to be expected.
                    








Precautions & Warnings






Renal:
 Patients with severe hepatic, cardiac or renal insufficiency or the elderly should be kept under close observation, since the use of NSAIDs may result in deterioration of renal function. The lowest effective dose should be used and renal function should be monitored. 
Hepatic:
 If abnormal liver function tests persist or worsen, clinical signs or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop or if other manifestations occur (eosinophilia, rash), Diclofenac should be discontinued. All patients who are receiving long term treatment with NSAIDs should be monitored as a precautionary measure (e.g., renal, hepatic function and blood counts).

Pharmacology





                            Dilofenac Sodium is a potent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with pronounced anti-rheumatic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. It has also some uricosuric effect. Diclofenac exerts its effect by inhibiting prostaglandin biosynthesis which plays a major role in causing inflammation, pain and fever. Diclofenac is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract when taken with or after meal. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within an average of 2 hours after ingestion of it. At therapeutic concentrations, it is 99.7% bound to plasma proteins. Diclofenac is metabolized in the liver and undergoes first pass metabolism.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Diclofenac FC Tablet
: Adults: 75-150 mg daily in 2 to 3 divided doses, preferably after food. Dose should be reduced in long term use. 
Diclofenac SR Tablet
: 




Adult
: 1 tablet daily, taken whole with liquid, preferably at meal times. If necessary, the daily dose can be increased to 150 mg by supplementation with conventional tablets.


Children
: 1-3 mg of diclofenac/kg body wt. daily in divided doses.


Elderly patients
: In elderly or debilitated patients, the lowest effective dosage is recommended, although the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium is not impaired to any clinically relevant extent in elderly patients.




Diclofenac Dispersible Tablet
:




Adults
: The recommended daily dosage is 2-3 tablets and the maximum daily dose is 150 mg. In milder cases, 2 tablets of Diclofenac DT per day are sufficient. Diclofenac DT should preferably be taken before meals.


Children
: Diclofenac is not recommended in children for other indications except juvenile rheumatoid arthritis where the recommended dose is 1-3 mg/kg body weight. Diclofenac DT is to be dropped into a half-glass of water and the liquid is to be stirred to aid dispersion before swallowing. There is no information on the use of Diclofenac DT for more than 03 months.




Diclofenac TR Capsule
: One capsule daily. Diclofenac TR should be taken preferably after mealtimes.
Diclofenac Suppository
: For adults: 50 mg suppository 2-3 times daily. Maximum daily dose is 150 mg.
Diclofenac injection
: For adults the usual dose is 1 ampoule daily. In serious cases this dose may be increased up to 2 ampoules daily.
Diclofenac Gel
: For external use only. Depending on the size of area to be treated, 2-4 g of Diclofenac gel should be applied to the skin 3-4 times daily. To the affected area gel should be rubbed in lightly. This gel may also be given in addition to further treatment with other dosage forms of Diclofenac.

Pharmacology





                            Flucloxacillin is active against Gram-positive organisms including penicillinase producing strains. It has little activity against Gram-negative bacilli. Flucloxacillin acts by inhibiting the formation of cell wall of bacteria. Flucloxacillin is isoxazolyl penicillin which combined the properties of resistance to hydrolysis by penicillinase, gastric acid stability and activity against gram-positive bacteria. Flucloxacillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that is particularly useful against penicillinase-producing staphylococci. Flucloxacillin kills bacterial cellwall, thus interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymeric structure that provides the cell wall with its mechanical stability. The final stage of peptidoglycan synthesis involves the completion of the cross-linking with the terminal glycine residue of the pentaglycin bridge linking to the fourth residue of the pentapeptide (D-alanine). The transpeptidase enzyme that performs this step is inhibited by Flucloxacillin. As a result the bacterial cellwall is weakened, the cell swells and then ruptures. Flucloxacillin resists the action of bacterial penicillinase probably because of the steric hindrance induced by the acyl side chain which prevents the opening of the β- lactam ring.

Interaction





                            Concurrent use of A-Flox and may result in increased level of A-Flox in blood for prolonged period.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Flucloxacillin is contraindicated in penicillin hypersensitive patients.
                    










Side Effects





                            There have been some common side effects of gastrointestinal tract such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia and other minor gastrointestinal disturbances. Besides these rashes, urticaria, purpura, fever, interstitial nephritis, hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            US FDA Pregnancy Category of Flucloxacillin is B. There are, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Flucloxacillin have been shown to be excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Flucloxacillin is administered to a lactating mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            A-Flox should be used with caution in patients with evidence of hepatic dysfunction. Caution should also be exercised in the treatment of patients with an allergic diathesis.
                    








Use in Special Populations





                            In severe renal failure (creatinine clearance <10 ml/min), a reduction in dose or an extension of dose interval should be considered.

Pharmacology





                            Flucloxacillin is active against Gram-positive organisms including penicillinase producing strains. It has little activity against Gram-negative bacilli. Flucloxacillin acts by inhibiting the formation of cell wall of bacteria. Flucloxacillin is isoxazolyl penicillin which combined the properties of resistance to hydrolysis by penicillinase, gastric acid stability and activity against gram-positive bacteria. Flucloxacillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that is particularly useful against penicillinase-producing staphylococci. Flucloxacillin kills bacterial cellwall, thus interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymeric structure that provides the cell wall with its mechanical stability. The final stage of peptidoglycan synthesis involves the completion of the cross-linking with the terminal glycine residue of the pentaglycin bridge linking to the fourth residue of the pentapeptide (D-alanine). The transpeptidase enzyme that performs this step is inhibited by Flucloxacillin. As a result the bacterial cellwall is weakened, the cell swells and then ruptures. Flucloxacillin resists the action of bacterial penicillinase probably because of the steric hindrance induced by the acyl side chain which prevents the opening of the β- lactam ring.
                    
























Dosage





                            Oral administration:



Adult
: 250 mg four times daily. Dosage may be doubled in severe infections. In osteomyelitis and endocarditis, up to 8 gm daily is used in 6-8 hourly divided doses.


Children (2-10 years)
: 1/2 of adult dose.


Children (Under 2 years)
: 1/4 of adult dose.



Parenteral administration:
Adult or Elderly:



Intramuscular Injection
: 250 mg four times daily.


Intravenous Injection
: 250 mg-1 g four times daily by slow injection over 3 to 4 minutes or by intravenous infusion.


All systemic doses may be doubled in severe infections
: doses up to 8 g daily have been suggested for endocarditis or osteomyelitis.



Children:



2-10 years
: half of the adult dose.


Under 2 years
: a quarter of the adult dose.

Interaction





                            Concurrent use of A-Flox and may result in increased level of A-Flox in blood for prolonged period.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Flucloxacillin is contraindicated in penicillin hypersensitive patients.
                    










Side Effects





                            There have been some common side effects of gastrointestinal tract such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia and other minor gastrointestinal disturbances. Besides these rashes, urticaria, purpura, fever, interstitial nephritis, hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            US FDA Pregnancy Category of Flucloxacillin is B. There are, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Flucloxacillin have been shown to be excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Flucloxacillin is administered to a lactating mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            A-Flox should be used with caution in patients with evidence of hepatic dysfunction. Caution should also be exercised in the treatment of patients with an allergic diathesis.
                    








Use in Special Populations





                            In severe renal failure (creatinine clearance <10 ml/min), a reduction in dose or an extension of dose interval should be considered.

Pharmacology





                            Flucloxacillin is active against Gram-positive organisms including penicillinase producing strains. It has little activity against Gram-negative bacilli. Flucloxacillin acts by inhibiting the formation of cell wall of bacteria. Flucloxacillin is isoxazolyl penicillin which combined the properties of resistance to hydrolysis by penicillinase, gastric acid stability and activity against gram-positive bacteria. Flucloxacillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that is particularly useful against penicillinase-producing staphylococci. Flucloxacillin kills bacterial cellwall, thus interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymeric structure that provides the cell wall with its mechanical stability. The final stage of peptidoglycan synthesis involves the completion of the cross-linking with the terminal glycine residue of the pentaglycin bridge linking to the fourth residue of the pentapeptide (D-alanine). The transpeptidase enzyme that performs this step is inhibited by Flucloxacillin. As a result the bacterial cellwall is weakened, the cell swells and then ruptures. Flucloxacillin resists the action of bacterial penicillinase probably because of the steric hindrance induced by the acyl side chain which prevents the opening of the β- lactam ring.

Interaction





                            Concurrent use of A-Flox and may result in increased level of A-Flox in blood for prolonged period.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Flucloxacillin is contraindicated in penicillin hypersensitive patients.
                    










Side Effects





                            There have been some common side effects of gastrointestinal tract such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia and other minor gastrointestinal disturbances. Besides these rashes, urticaria, purpura, fever, interstitial nephritis, hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            US FDA Pregnancy Category of Flucloxacillin is B. There are, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Flucloxacillin have been shown to be excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Flucloxacillin is administered to a lactating mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            A-Flox should be used with caution in patients with evidence of hepatic dysfunction. Caution should also be exercised in the treatment of patients with an allergic diathesis.
                    








Use in Special Populations





                            In severe renal failure (creatinine clearance <10 ml/min), a reduction in dose or an extension of dose interval should be considered.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Penicillinase-resistant penicillins
                    








Reconstitution





                            A-Flox has been used in other routes in conjunction with systemic therapy. It has been administered in a dose of 250 mg to 500 mg daily by intraarticular injection, dissolved if necessary in a 0.5% solution of lignocaine hydrochloride, and by intrapleural injection in a dose of 250 mg daily.

Pharmacology





                            Beta-carotene, retinol, and retinal have effective and reliable vitamin A activity. Retinal and retinol are in chemical equilibrium in the body and have equivalent antixerophthalmic activity. Retinal combines with the rod pigment, opsin, in the retina to form rhodopsin, necessary for visual dark adaptation.
Vitamin A prevents retardation of growth and preserves the epithe-lial cells' integrity. Normal adult liver storage is sufficient to satisfy two years'requirements of vitamin A. Vitamin A is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, where the biosynthesis of vitamin A from beta-carotene takes place. Vitamin A absorption requires bile salts, pancreatic lipase, and dietary fat. It is transported in the blood to the liver by the chy lomicron fraction of the lymph. Vitamin Ais stored in Kupffer cells of the liver mainly as the palmitate. Normal serum vitamin A is 80-300 Units per 100 mL (plasma range is 30-70 mcg per dl) and for carotenoids 270-753 Units per 100 mL.The normal adult liver contains approximately 100 to 300 micrograms per gram, mostly as retinol palmitate.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            For Adults: 50000 IU-100000 IU daily up to 200000 IU if necessary.

                            A-Forte intoxication includes irritability, vomiting, loss of appetite, headache, dry and pruritic skin, skin desquamation, fatique, pain in ankles and feet, myalgia, loss of body hair, papilledema, nystagmus, liver sclerosis and cirrhosis.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Safety of amounts exceeding 6,000 Units of vitamin A daily during pregnancy has not been established at this time. The use of vitamin A in excess of the recommended dietary allowance may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal reproduction studies have shown fetal abnormalities associated with over-dosage in several species. Malformations of the central nervous system, the eye, the palate, and the urogenital tract are recorded. Vitamin Ain excess of the recommended dietary allowance is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If vitamin Ais used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking vitamin A, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. 
The U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of vitamin A (5,000 Units) is recommended for nursing mothers.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Ensure A-Forte free interval after long term therapy with A-Forte. No daily dose over 5000 IU during pregnancy. A-Forte doses over 50000 IU under medical supervision only.

Composition






Each box
 
contains 2 blister strips
.




One strip contains 1 tablet of Mifepristone INN 200 mg
.


Another strip contains 4 tablets of Misoprostol USP 200 microgram each.




































Pharmacology





                            Mifepristone: Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid with anti-progestational activity results from competitive interaction with progesterone at progesterone-receptor sites. Based on studies with various oral doses in several animal species, the compound inhibits the activity of endogenous or exogenous progesterone and the Menstrual Regulation (MR) results. During pregnancy, the compound sensitizes the myometrium to the contraction-inducing activity of prostaglandins.
Misoprostol: Misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1. It causes myometrial contraction by interacting with specific receptors on myometrial cells. This interaction results in a change in calcium concentration, thereby initiating muscle contraction. By interacting with prostaglandin receptors, Misoprostol causes the cervix to soften and the uterus to contract, resulting in the expulsion of the uterine contents.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            This can only be prescribed by qualified medical professionals who are able to assess the gestational age of an embryo and to diagnose ectopic pregnancies. The qualified medical professionals must also be able to provide surgical Intervention/MVA (Manual Vaccum Aspiration) in cases of incomplete abortion or severe bleeding or have made plans to provide such care through others and be able to assure patient access to medical facilities equipped to provide blood transfusions and resuscitation, if necessary.
Day 1 (First visit)
: Mifepristone administration: One tablet of Mifepristone (200 mg) is taken in a single oral dose under the supervision of a qualified medical professional in a clinic, medical office or hospital.
Day 2 (Second visit)
: Misoprostol administration: 24-48 hours after ingesting the Mifepristone tablet, the patient takes four 200 microgram tablets (800 micrograms) of Misoprostol buccally or sublingually. Misoprostol tablets can be administered by the patient herself (place two tablets on each side of cheeck & gum or under the tongue). She should wait for 30 minutes. During the period immediately following the administration of Misoprostol, the patient may need medication for cramps or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient should be given instructions on what to do if significant discomfort, excessive bleeding or other adverse reactions occur and should be given a phone number to call if she has questions following the administration of Misoprostol. 
Day 10 to 14 (Third visit)
: Post-treatment examination: Patients must return to the clinic, medical office or hospital within 10 to 14 days after the administration of mifepristone. This visit is very important to confirm by clinical examination or ultrasonographic scan that a complete termination of pregnancy has occurred. 
Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at this visit have a risk of fetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/termination of pregnancy failures.

Interaction





                            Mifepristone: Although specific drug or food interactions with Mifepristone have not been studied, on the basis of A-Kit's metabolism by CYP 3A4, it is possible that Ketoconazole, Itraconazole, Erythromycin and grapefruit juice may inhibit its metabolism (increasing serum levels of mifepristone).
Misoprostol: Misoprostol has not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption,blood levels and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Administration of Mifepristone is contraindicated in patients with any one of the following conditions: History of allergy or known hypersensitivity to Mifepristone, Misoprostol or other prostaglandin, confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy or undiagnosed adnexal mass (the treatment procedure will not be effective to terminate an ectopic pregnancy), IUD in place, chronic adrenal failure, haemorrhagic disorders or concurrent anticoagulant therapy, inherited porphyria, If a patient does not have adequate access to medical facilities equipped to provide emergency treatment of incomplete process, blood transfusions and emergency resuscitation during the period from the first visit until discharged by the administering physician.
                    










Side Effects





                            Mifepristone: The treatment procedure is designed to induce vaginal bleeding and uterine cramping necessary for Menstrual Regulation (MR). Commonly reported side effects were nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Pelvic pain, fainting, headache, dizziness, and asthenia occurred rarely.
Misoprostol: Gastro-intestinal side-effects like diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, dyspepsia, headache, vomiting and constipation, shivering, hyperthermia, dizziness, pain due to uterine contractions, severe vaginal bleeding, shock, pelvic pain, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy and/or salpingo-oophorectomy).
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy- 
Mifepristone
: is indicated for Menstrual Regulation (MR) (through 63 days pregnancy) and has no other approved indication for use during pregnancy. Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at the last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR) treatment failures.
Lactation- 




Mifepristone
: It is not known whether Mifepristone is excreted through human milk. Many hormones with a similar chemical structure, however, are excreted in breast milk. Since the effects of Mifepristone on infants are unknown, breast-feeding women should consult with their doctor to decide if they should discard their breast milk for a few days following administration of the medications.


Misoprostol
: Although it is not known whether Misoprostol or Misoprostol is excreted through human milk, Misoprostol should not be administered to nursing mothers because the potential excretion of misoprostol acid could cause diarrhoea in nursing infants.












Precautions & Warnings





                            The patient should not give combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol to anyone else. The combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, it may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she is or were to become pregnant. Any Intra Uterine Device [IUD] should be removed before treatment with Mifepristone begins. Menstrual Regulation (MR) by surgery is recommended in cases when combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol fails to cause Menstrual Regulation (MR). Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/ termination of pregnancy failures.
                    








Use in Special Populations





                            Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic disease should receive a decreased dose of Misoprostol.
Use in Patients with Renal Impairment: No routine dosage adjustment is recommended of Misoprostol in older patients or patients with renal impairment but the dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Mifepristone: No serious adverse reactions were reported in tolerance studies in healthy nonpregnant female and healthy male subjects where Mifepristone was administered in single doses greater than threefold of 600mg for Menstrual Regulation (MR). If a patient ingests a massive overdose, she should be observed closely for signs of adrenal failure.
Misoprostol: Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are a sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fever, palpitations, hypotension or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. However, because Misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be the appropriate treatment for overdosage.

Description





                            A-Meb is a musculotropic antispasmodic agent used to relieve cramps or spasms of the stomach and intestine (gut). It is particularly useful in treating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and similar conditions. It works by relaxing the muscles and helping restore the normal movement of the gut.
                    




































Dosage & Administration





                            For adults, elderly and children over 10 years:




Mebeverine Hydrochloride 135 mg tablet
: 1 tablet 03 times daily.


Mebeverine Hydrochloride 200 mg capsule
: 1 capsule 02 times daily.



This is most effective when taken 20 minutes before meals. After several weeks when the desired effect has been obtained, the dosage may be gradually reduced.
Missed dose
: If a dose of this medicine is missed, that should be taken as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, then skip the missed dose and the regular dosing schedule should be maintained. Dose should not be doubled at the same time to compensate the missed dose.
Use in children
: Mebeverine is not recommended for children under 10 years.

Contraindications





                            Hypersensitivity to the drug or any other ingredients.
                    










Side Effects





                            Generally A-Meb is well tolerated. However, few side-effects like skin rash, urticaria and angioedema may appear
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            No teratogenicity has been shown in animal experiments. However, the usual precautions concerning the administration of any drug during pregnancy should be exercised. Mebeverine does not excrete in the breast milk after administering at therapeutic dose.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Caution should be exercised in porphyria or allergic reaction to this or any other medicine of this group.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            On theoretical grounds it may be predicted that CNS excitability will occur in case of overdosage. No specific antidote is known: gastric lavage and symptomatic treatment is recommended
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Anticholinergics

Head lice.




Strongyloidiasis of the intestinal tract:
 A-Mectin is indicated for the treatment of intestinal (i.e., nondisseminated) strongyloidiasis due to the nematode parasite Strongyloides stercoralis. This indication is based on clinical studies of both comparative and open-label designs, in which 64-100% of infected patients were cured following a single 200-mcg/kg dose of A-Mectin.
Onchocerciasis
: A-Mectin is indicated for the treatment of onchocerciasis due to the nematode parasite Onchocerca volvulus. This indication is based on randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and comparative studies conducted in 1427 patients in onchocerciasis-endemic areas of West Africa. The comparative studies used diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC-C).

Pharmacology





                            Ivermectin selectively binds and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels, which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells leading to an increase in the permeability of cell membranes to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell and, ultimately, death of the parasite.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






For Treatment (If COVIO Positive)
: 2 Tablets of Ivermectin 6 mg once daily for 5 days. (2+0+0 for 5 days).
For Prophylaxis
: Single-dose as mentioned below to be taken on Day 1 & same dose on Day 7. 




Body Weight 15-24 kg: 1 Tablet of Ivermectin 3 mg


Body Weight 25-35 kg: 1 Tablet of Ivermectin 6 mg


Body Weight 36-50 kg: 1 Tablet of Ivermectin 6 mg + 1 Tablet of Ivermectin 3 mg


Body Weight 51-65 kg: 2 Tablets of Ivermectin 6 mg


Body Weight 66-79 kg: 2 Tablets of Ivermectin 6 mg + 1 Tablet of Ivermectin 3 mg


Body Weight >80 kg: 3 Tablets of Ivermectin 6 mg




Strongyloidiasis
: The recommended dosage of Ivermectin for the treatment of strongyloidiasis is a single oral dose designed to provide approximately 200 mcg/kg of body weight. Patients should take tablets on an empty stomach with water. In general, additional doses are not necessary. However, follow-up stool examinations should be performed to verify eradication of infection. 
Dosage Guidelines for Ivermectin for Strongyloidiasis:




Body Weight (kg) 15-24: Dose 3 mg/kg


Body Weight (kg) 25-35: Dose 6 mg/kg


Body Weight (kg) 36-50: Dose 9 mg/kg


Body Weight (kg) 51-65: Dose 12 mg/kg


Body Weight (kg) 66-79: Dose 15 mg/kg


Body Weight (kg) >80: Dose 200 mcg/kg




Onchocerciasis
: The recommended dosage of Ivermectin is a single oral dose designed to provide approximately 150 mcg of Ivermectin per kg of body weight on an empty stomach with water, the most commonly used dose interval is 12 months. For the treatment of individual patients, retreatment may be considered at intervals as short as 3 months. 
Dosage Guidelines for Ivermectin for Onchocerciasis:




Body Weight (kg) 15-25: Dose 3 mg/kg


Body Weight (kg) 26-44: Dose 6 mg/kg


Body Weight (kg) 45-64: Dose 9 mg/kg


Body Weight (kg) 65-84: Dose 12 mg/kg

Interaction





                            Post-marketing reports of increased INR (International Normalized Ratio) have been rarely reported when A-Mectin was co-administered with warfarin.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.
                    










Side Effects






Strongyloidiasis
: In four clinical studies involving a total of 109 patients given either one or two doses of 170 to 200 mcg/kg of A-Mectin, the following adverse reactions were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to A-Mectin.




Body as a whole
: asthenia/fatigue (0.9%), abdominal pain (0.9%)


Gastrointestinal
: anorexia (0.9%), constipation (0.9%), diarrhea (1.8%), nausea (1.8%), vomiting (0.9%) Nervous System/Psychiatric: dizziness (2.8%), somnolence (0.9%), vertigo (0.9%), tremor (0.9%)


Skin
: pruritus (2.8%), rash (0.9%), and urticaria (0.9%).




Onchocerciasis
: arthralgia/synovitis (19.3%), axillary lymph node enlargement and tenderness (11.0% and 4.4%, respectively), cervical lymph node enlargement and tenderness (5.3% and 1.2%, respectively), inguinal lymph node enlargement and tenderness (12.6% and 13.9%, respectively), other lymph node enlargement and tenderness (3.0% and 1.9%, respectively), pruritus (27.5%), skin involvement including edema, papular and pustular or frank urticarial rash (22.7%), and fever (22.6%), abnormal sensation in the eyes, eyelid edema, anterior uveitis, conjunctivitis, limbitis, keratitis, and chorioretinitis or choroiditis. These have rarely been severe or associated with loss of vision and have generally resolved without corticosteroid treatment. The following adverse reactions have been reported since the drug was registered overseas: hypotension (mainly orthostatic hypotension), worsening of bronchial asthma, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy Category C. Ivermectin does not appear to be selectively fetotoxic to the developing fetus. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ivermectin should not be used during pregnancy since safety in pregnancy has not been established.
Nursing Mothers: Ivermectin is excreted in human milk in low concentrations. Treatment of mothers who intend to breast feed should only be undertaken when the risk of delayed treatment to the mother outweighs the possible risk to the newborn
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Historical data have shown that microfilaricidal drugs, such as diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC-C), might cause cutaneous and/or systemic reactions of varying severity (the Mazzotti reaction) and ophthalmological reactions in patients with onchocerciasis. These reactions are probably due to allergic and inflammatory responses to the death of microfilariae. Patients treated with A-Mectin for onchocerciasis may experience these reactions in addition to clinical adverse reactions possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug itself. The treatment of severe Mazzotti reactions has not been subjected to controlled clinical trials. Oral hydration, recumbency, intravenous normal saline, and/or parenteral corticosteroids have been used to treat postural hypotension. Antihistamines and/or aspirin have been used for most mild to moderate cases. After treatment with microfilaricidal drugs, patients with hyperreactive onchodermatitis (sowda) may be more likely than others to experience severe adverse reactions, especially edema and aggravation of onchodermatitis. Rarely, patients with onchocerciasis who are also heavily infected with Loa loa may develop a serious or even fatal encephalopathy either spontaneously or following treatment with an effective microfilaricide. In these patients, the following adverse experiences have also been reported: back pain, conjunctival hemorrhage, dyspnea, urinary and/or fecal incontinence, difficulty in standing/walking, mental status changes, confusion, lethargy, stupor, or coma.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients weighing less than 15 kg have not been established.
Geriatric Use
: Clinical studies of A-Mectin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Anthelmintic
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Keep in a dry place, below 30°C. Protect from light. Keep out of the reach of children.

Pharmacology






Pharmacodynamics
: Miconazole possesses an antifungal activity against the common dermatophytes and yeasts as well as an antibacterial activity against certain gram-positive bacilli and cocci. Its activity is based on the inhibition of a demethylation step in the ergosterol biosynthesis. Ergosterol, the end-product of the biosynthetic pathway and the main sterol in yeast and fungi. The disruption in production of ergosterol disrupts the fungal cell membrane, causing holes to appear in it. These holes allow the essential constituents of the fungal cells to leak out and ultimately the fungal cells die.
Pharmacokinetics
: The oral bioavailability of Miconazole is low (25-30%) because there is little absorption of Miconazole from the intestinal tract. Miconazole is systemically absorbed after administration as the oral gel. Absorbed Miconazole is bound to plasma proteins (88.2%), primarily to serum albumin and red blood cells (10.6%). The absorbed portion of Miconazole oral gel is largely metabolized; less than 1% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. The terminal plasma half-life is 20-25 hours in most patients. The elimination half-life of Miconazole is similar in any renal impaired patient.
                    
























Dosage






Miconazole Oral Gel
-
Oropharyngeal candidosis-




Infants 4-24 months
: 1.25 ml (1⁄4 measuring spoon) of gel, applied 4 times day after meals.


Adult and children 2 years of age and older
: 2.5 ml (1⁄2 measuring spoon) of gel, applied 4 times a day after meals.



Gastrointestinal tract candidosis-




Infants (4 months of age or above)
: Children and adults who have difficulty swallowing tablets: 20 mg per kg body weight per day, in four divided doses. The daily dose should not exceed 250 mg (10 ml gel) four times daily.



Missed Dose: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember. In case of next dosing time, omit the missed
dose and continue your usual course.
Miconazole Cream
: Sufficient Miconazole Cream should be applied to cover affected areas twice daily (morning and evening) in patients with tinea pedis, tinea cruris, tinea corporis and cutaneous candidiasis and once daily in patients with tinea versicolor. If Miconazole Cream is used in intertriginous areas it should be applied sparingly and smoothed in well to avoid maceration effects.
Early relief of symptoms (2 to 3 days) is experienced by the majority of patients and clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun.All lesions usually disappear after 2 to 5 weeks.Prolong treatment for 10 days to prevent relapse. However, Candida infections, tinea cruris and corporis should be treated for two weeks and tinea pedis for one month in order to reduce the possibility of recurrence.

'




















Administration





                            In case of localized lesions of the mouth, a small amount of gel may be applied 2-4 times a day directly to the affected area with a clean finger. For best results, Miconazole oral gel should be kept in contact with the affected area as long as possible. The treatment should be continued for at least a week after symptoms have disappeared. For oral candidosis, dental prosthesis should be removed at night and brushed with the gel.

Interaction








Concomitant treatment with Terfenadine, Astemizole and Cisapride should be avoided because in vitro studies suggest that A-Migel may inhibit their metabolism, so these products miqht precipitated.


A-Migel may delay Phenytoin and Cyclosporine metabolism and this might precipitate Phenytoin and Cyclosporine toxicity, respectively.
























Contraindications





                            Miconazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient.
                    










Side Effects





                            Occasionally nausea and vomiting, diarrhea with long term use and rarely allergic reactions.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            There is no information regarding the safety of Miconazole oral gel during pregnancy. So Miconazole oral gel should be avoided in pregnant women if possible or the potential hazards should be balanced against the possible benefits. As many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Miconazole is administered to a nursing woman.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            If the concomitant use of A-Migel and anticoagulant is considered, the anti-coagulant effect should be monitored and titrated. A-Migel and phenytoin plasma level should also be monitored when used concomitantly. In infants and young children, caution must be taken to ensure that the gel does not obstruct the throat.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Accidental overdosage may cause vomiting and diarrhea. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. A specific antidote is not available.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Aural Anti-fungal preparations
                    








Storage Conditions

Pharmacology





                            Erythromycin is a bacteriostatic macrolide antibiotic. But may be bactericidal in high concentrations. Although the mechanism by which Erythromycin acts in reducing the inflammatory lesions of acne vulgaris is unknown, it is presumably due to the antibiotic action of the drug.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            Apply in morning and evening to the affected areas. Before applying thoroughly wash with warm water and soap, rinse and pat dry all areas to be treated. Apply with fingertips or applicator. Wash hands after use. Spread the medication lightly rather than rubbing it in. Acne lesions on the face, neck, shoulders, chest and back may be treated in this manner. Additional containers may be used, if needed. Each container should be used once and discarded.

Contraindications





                            Hypersensitivity to Erythromycin or to any of the other ingredients of the lotion.
                    










Side Effects





                            Erythema, desquamation, burning sensation, eye irritation, tenderness, dryness, oily skin etc.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Safety for use during pregnancy has not been established. Use only when the potential benefits outweigh potential hazards to the fetus. Erythromycin is excreted in breast milk. Exercise caution when administering to a nursing mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            For external use only. Keep away from eyes, nose, mouth and other mucous membrane. Use of antibiotics (especially prolonged or repeated therapy) may result in bacterial or fungal overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms. Such overgrowth may lead to a secondary infection. Take appropriate measures if superinfections occur.
                    








Use in Special Populations





                            Safety and effectiveness in children less than 12 years have not been established.

Description





                            A-Mycin belongs to the macrolides group of antibiotics. It exerts a bacteriostatic or bactericidal action based on specific interference with ribosomal protein synthesis within the bacterial cell. THROCIN is mainly used for the treatment of infections caused by penicillinase producing staphylococci. The following micro-organisms are particularly susceptible to A-Mycin. Gram (+)ve : Cocci and bacilli. Gram (-)ve : Neisseria catarhalis, N.meningitis, N.gonorrhoea, Haemophilus influenzae, Brodetella, H. pertussis.Other micro-organisms : Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Bacteroides fragilis, B.oralis, B.melaninogenicus, Fusobacterium, Chlamydia trachomatis, Treponema pallidum.
                    




















Pharmacology





                            Erythromycin inhibits microsomal protein synthesis in susceptible organisms by inhibiting the translocation process. Specific binding to the 50S subunit or 70S ribosome occurs in these organisms but there is no binding to the stable 80S mammalian ribosome. Erythromycin is active against many Grampositive bacteria, some Gram-negative bacteria and against mycoplasmas and chlamydia.
Absorption
: Erythromycin base is destroyed by acid and is therefore administered in the form of stable ester. The rates of absorption of the base and esters are diminished by the presence of food. The stearate is hydrolyzed in the intestine and the free erythromycin absorbed. 
Blood concentration
: After an oral dose of 500 mg. of the base of stearate, peak serum concentrations of 0.9 to 1.4 or 0.4 to 1.8 mg/ml. respectively are attained in 1 to 4 hours. Half-life: The serum half-life is 1.2 to 4 hours. In subjects with oliguria, the half-life is about 5 hours.
Distribution
: Erythromycin is widely distributed throughout body tissue and fluids with some retention in the liver and spleen, protein binding of erythromycin base is 73%. Erythromycin enters the cerebrospinal fluid when the meninges are inflamed. It also crosses the placenta and is excreted in the milk.
Excretion
: 5 to 15 % of the dose of erythromycin is excreted in the urine and large amounts of the unchanged active substance are excreted in the bile.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adult and Children over 8 years
: 250-500 mg every six hours for mild to moderate infections. This may be increased upto 4 gm. or more daily in severe cases.
Elderly
: No special dosage recommendation. Erythromycin may be administered if desired, three times daily or twice daily by giving one-third or half of the total daily requirement 8 hourly or 12 hourly respectively. 
Children aged 2 to 8 years
: 250 mg. every six hours or 30-50 mg/kg body weight per day divided into four equal dosage. 
Infants and Children upto 2 years
: 500 mg. in divided doses or 30-50 mg/kg body weight in divided doses.

Interaction





                            Recent data from studies of A-Mycin reveals that its use in patients who are receiving high dosage of theophylline may be associated with an increase of serum theophylline levels and potential theophylline toxicity. In such cases this dose of theophylline should be reduced.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Known hypersensitivity to Erythromycin.
                    










Side Effects





                            Allergic reactions are rare and mild although anaphylaxis has occurred. Occasionally there is abdominal discomfort after oral administration, sometimes with nausea and vomiting. This discomfort usually subsides after a few days without it being necessary to reduce the dosage.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Clinical and Laboratory studies have been shown no evidence in human of teratogenicity or toxicity. However, caution should be exercised when prescribing this drug to pregnant patients and lactating mothers since erythromycin crosses the placental barrier and is excreted in breast milk.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            A-Mycin should be given with care in patients with impaired hepatic function, as A-Mycin is excreted principally in the bile.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            In case of overdosage, A-Mycin should be discontinued. Overdosage should be handled with the prompt elimination of unabsorbed drug and all other appropriate measures should be instituted. A-Mycin is not removed by peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Anti-diarrhoeal Antimicrobial drugs, Macrolides

Description





                            A-Mycin belongs to the macrolides group of antibiotics. It exerts a bacteriostatic or bactericidal action based on specific interference with ribosomal protein synthesis within the bacterial cell. THROCIN is mainly used for the treatment of infections caused by penicillinase producing staphylococci. The following micro-organisms are particularly susceptible to A-Mycin. Gram (+)ve : Cocci and bacilli. Gram (-)ve : Neisseria catarhalis, N.meningitis, N.gonorrhoea, Haemophilus influenzae, Brodetella, H. pertussis.Other micro-organisms : Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Bacteroides fragilis, B.oralis, B.melaninogenicus, Fusobacterium, Chlamydia trachomatis, Treponema pallidum.
                    




















Pharmacology





                            Erythromycin inhibits microsomal protein synthesis in susceptible organisms by inhibiting the translocation process. Specific binding to the 50S subunit or 70S ribosome occurs in these organisms but there is no binding to the stable 80S mammalian ribosome. Erythromycin is active against many Grampositive bacteria, some Gram-negative bacteria and against mycoplasmas and chlamydia.
Absorption
: Erythromycin base is destroyed by acid and is therefore administered in the form of stable ester. The rates of absorption of the base and esters are diminished by the presence of food. The stearate is hydrolyzed in the intestine and the free erythromycin absorbed. 
Blood concentration
: After an oral dose of 500 mg. of the base of stearate, peak serum concentrations of 0.9 to 1.4 or 0.4 to 1.8 mg/ml. respectively are attained in 1 to 4 hours. Half-life: The serum half-life is 1.2 to 4 hours. In subjects with oliguria, the half-life is about 5 hours.
Distribution
: Erythromycin is widely distributed throughout body tissue and fluids with some retention in the liver and spleen, protein binding of erythromycin base is 73%. Erythromycin enters the cerebrospinal fluid when the meninges are inflamed. It also crosses the placenta and is excreted in the milk.
Excretion
: 5 to 15 % of the dose of erythromycin is excreted in the urine and large amounts of the unchanged active substance are excreted in the bile.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adult and Children over 8 years
: 250-500 mg every six hours for mild to moderate infections. This may be increased upto 4 gm. or more daily in severe cases.
Elderly
: No special dosage recommendation. Erythromycin may be administered if desired, three times daily or twice daily by giving one-third or half of the total daily requirement 8 hourly or 12 hourly respectively. 
Children aged 2 to 8 years
: 250 mg. every six hours or 30-50 mg/kg body weight per day divided into four equal dosage. 
Infants and Children upto 2 years
: 500 mg. in divided doses or 30-50 mg/kg body weight in divided doses.

Interaction





                            Recent data from studies of A-Mycin reveals that its use in patients who are receiving high dosage of theophylline may be associated with an increase of serum theophylline levels and potential theophylline toxicity. In such cases this dose of theophylline should be reduced.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Known hypersensitivity to Erythromycin.
                    










Side Effects





                            Allergic reactions are rare and mild although anaphylaxis has occurred. Occasionally there is abdominal discomfort after oral administration, sometimes with nausea and vomiting. This discomfort usually subsides after a few days without it being necessary to reduce the dosage.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Clinical and Laboratory studies have been shown no evidence in human of teratogenicity or toxicity. However, caution should be exercised when prescribing this drug to pregnant patients and lactating mothers since erythromycin crosses the placental barrier and is excreted in breast milk.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            A-Mycin should be given with care in patients with impaired hepatic function, as A-Mycin is excreted principally in the bile.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            In case of overdosage, A-Mycin should be discontinued. Overdosage should be handled with the prompt elimination of unabsorbed drug and all other appropriate measures should be instituted. A-Mycin is not removed by peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Anti-diarrhoeal Antimicrobial drugs, Macrolides

Pharmacology





                            Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat

Interaction





                            Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of A-One. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of A-One overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic A-One levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of A-One are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care is advised in the administration of A-One to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other A-One-containing products concurrently. A-One should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of A-One in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of A-One. Use caution when administering A-One in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue A-One IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use A-One IV in patients with A-One allergy.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of A-One IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of A-One IV in adults.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
: A-One is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of A-One may be warranted.
Patients with Renal Impairment
: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of A-One may be warranted.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of A-One. Ingestion of 5 g or more of A-One may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms
: Symptoms of A-One overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of A-One overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma A-One concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of A-One. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.

Pharmacology





                            This is a combination of Paracetamol and Caffeine. Paracetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Caffeine is an alkaloid which is a theophylline-like xanthine derivative. By intermolecular association with Paracetamol, Caffeine increases the solubility and transmembrane permeation of Paracetamol. In addition, Caffeine increases the pain threshold and tolerance of pain. Caffeine has also an intrinsic power to raise vessel tone in the brain, which provides another benefit to treat migraine and headache.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adult dose
: 1-2 tablets every 4-6 hours. Maximum dose: 8 tablets daily. 
Child dose
: Not recommended for children below 12 years.

Pharmacology





                            Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat

Interaction





                            Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of A-One XR. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of A-One XR overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic A-One XR levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of A-One XR are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care is advised in the administration of A-One XR to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other A-One XR-containing products concurrently. A-One XR should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of A-One XR in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of A-One XR. Use caution when administering A-One XR in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue A-One XR IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use A-One XR IV in patients with A-One XR allergy.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of A-One XR IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of A-One XR IV in adults.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
: A-One XR is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of A-One XR may be warranted.
Patients with Renal Impairment
: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of A-One XR may be warranted.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of A-One XR. Ingestion of 5 g or more of A-One XR may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms
: Symptoms of A-One XR overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of A-One XR overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma A-One XR concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of A-One XR. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.

'














































Pharmacology





                            Chloramphenicol is a broad-spectrum bacteriostatic antibiotic which acts through the inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interfering with the transfer of activated amino acids from soluble RNA to ribosomes.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adult and Children
: Instill 1 or 2 drops in the conjunctival sac 4-6 times per day for the first 72 hours and then every 4 hours thereafter. Treatment should be continued for approximately 7 days, but should not be continued for more than 3 weeks without re-evaluation by the physician.

Interaction





                            Chymotrypsin may be inhibited if given simultaneously with A-Phenicol.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to Chloramphenicol or any ingredients of the preparation.
                    










Side Effects





                            The systemic adverse reaction has not been observed within short-term topical use of A-Phenicol. The most frequently reported adverse reactions have been burning, stinging, conjunctival hyperemia, blood dyscrasia, allergic or inflammatory reactions, vesicular and maculopapular dermatitis.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Safety for use in pregnancy and lactation has not been established. Therefore, use only when considered essential by the physicians.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            A-Phenicol ophthalmic solution should never be given for minor infections or for prophylaxis. Repeated course and prolonged treatment should be avoided. Blood dyscrasias (granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and moderate anaemia) may occur after prolonged ophthalmic use.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Accidental ingestion of the medicine is unlikely to cause any toxicity due to low content of antibiotic.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Ear Anti-Infectives & Antiseptics, Eye Anti-Infectives & Antiseptics, Macrolides

Pharmacology





                            Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid. It has an anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic action. It is used topically in the treatment of inflammatory conditions of the anterior segment of the eye. Dexamethasone is absorbed rapidly after oral administration with a half-life of about 190 minutes. Sufficient absorption may occur after topical application to the skin and eye to produce systemic effects.
Chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum bacteriostatic antibiotic active against a wide variety of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. Chloramphenicol exerts its antibacterial effect by binding to bacterial ribosomes and inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis at an early stage
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Eye
:




Bacterial Conjunctivitis
: The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis is 1 to 2 drops instilled into the conjunctival sac (s) every 2 hours for 2 days and 1 or 2 drops every 4 hours for the next 5(five days) while awake.


Corneal Ulcers
: The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of comeal ulcer is 2 drops in the affected eye (s) every 15 minutes for the first 6 hours then 2 drops into the affected eye(s) every 30 minutes for the remainder of first day. On the second day, instill 2 drops in the affected eye (s) hourly. On the 3 to 14 days, place 2 drops in the affected eye (s) every 4 hours. Treatment may be continued after 14 days if corneal re-epithelialization has not occurred.




Ear
: For all infections, 2 to 3 drops every 2 to 3 hours initially. Frequency should be decreased gradually as warranted by improvement in clinical signs. Care should be taken not to discontinue therapy prematurely.

Interaction





                            If Chloramphenicol is absorbed from eye when taking anticoagulants e.g. warfarin, there may be an increase in the effect of this medicine. Action of Chloramphenicol will be inhibited if given simultaneously with Phenobarbital. The therapeutic efficacy of Dexamethasone may be reduced with the concomitant administration of phenytoin, phenobarbitone, ephedrine and rifampicin.
                    




















Contraindications





                            The combination is contraindicated in epithelial herpes simplex cornealis, fungal, viral, tuberculous and other infections of the eye and in glaucoma. Myelosuppression during previous exposure to Chloramphenicol. Hypersensitivity to Chloramphenicol & Dexamethasone Phosphate or to any other ingredients of the preparations.
                    










Side Effects





                            Adverse reactions seen with Chloramphenicol are transient ocular burning or discomfort and other reported reactions include stinging, redness, itching, conjunctivitis, foreign body sensation, photophobia, blurred vision, dryness and eye pain. Allergic sensitization may occur with the local use of Chloramphenicol. Elevation of intraocular pressure with possible development of glaucoma, infrequent optic nerve damage and posterior subcapsular cataract formation.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Caution should be exercised when Chloramphenicol and Dexamethasone ophthalmic solution is administered to a nursing mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            The possibility of persistent fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after prolonged corticosteroid dosing. Prolonged use of steroids containing products may result in posterior subcapsular cataract formation and glaucoma with optic nerve damage. Intraocular pressure monitoring is needed. Prolonged use of antibiotics may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If new infections appear during treatment, the drug should be discontinued and alternative therapy should be instituted.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Ophthalmic steroid - antibiotic combined preparations
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Keep in a cool and dry place, away from light & keep out of the reach of children. Do not use after 30 days of first opening.

Description





                            A-Rox, is a macrolide with antibacterial properties similar to erythromycin. It is active against Gram-positive bacteria like staphylococci, streptococci, listeria, corynebacteria; Gram-negative bacteria such as gonococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus ducreyi, Legionella, campylobacter, and atypical pathogens like Mycoplasma and Chlamydia. A-Rox has been found useful in the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infection, otorhinolaryngological, skin, dental and genital infections. It is well tolerated by adults and children.
                    




















Pharmacology





                            Roxithromycin inhibits protein synthesis by irreversibly binding to the 50s ribosomal subunits thus blocking the transpeptidation or translocation reactions of susceptible organisms resulting in stunted cell growth.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adult dose
: The usual dose for adults is one 300 mg tablet once daily or one 150 mg tablet twice a day for at least two days after resolution of symptoms, a normal course of therapy is between 5 and 10 days. Roxithromycin is best administered on empty stomach. In severe hepatic impairment the dose is 150 mg once daily.
Pediatric dose
: The dose for children is 2.5 to 5 mg/kg body weight twice a day. The following general guidelines can be followed




6 to 11 Kg
: 25 mg Roxithromycin 12 hourly.


12 to 23 Kg
: 50 mg Roxithromycin 12 hourly.


24 to 40 Kg
: 100 mg Roxithromycin 12 hourly.



A normal course of therapy is between 5 and 10 days.

Interaction





                            A-Rox does not have any affinity for cytochrome P-450 binding sites and thus is unlikely to produce drug interaction mediated by this enzymatic system. A-Rox shows mild interaction with theophylline though this has not been found to produce clinically relevant effects. Alteration in the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine or warfarin has not been found. Antacids, H2- receptor antagonists and food has no effect on the absorption of A-Rox.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Roxithromycin should not be administered simultaneously with ergotamine or its derivatives as it may provoke arterial spasm and severe ischaemia.
                    










Side Effects





                            A-Rox is well tolerated by patients of all age groups. Less than 4% of treated patients complain of side effects mainly nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and hypersensitivity rash. Other side effects reported include vomiting, dizziness, headache, pruritus, dyspepsia, flatulence, tinnitus, vertigo and constipation. These are in general minor and do not necessitate withdrawal of therapy.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            The safety of Roxithromycin in pregnancy has not been established. It appears in breast milk in small amounts and dose not produce adverse effects in the breast fed infant.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            A-Rox should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to the drug. In patients with hepatic diseases the dose of A-Rox should not exceed 150 mg twice a day.

Description





                            A-Rox, is a macrolide with antibacterial properties similar to erythromycin. It is active against Gram-positive bacteria like staphylococci, streptococci, listeria, corynebacteria; Gram-negative bacteria such as gonococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus ducreyi, Legionella, campylobacter, and atypical pathogens like Mycoplasma and Chlamydia. A-Rox has been found useful in the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infection, otorhinolaryngological, skin, dental and genital infections. It is well tolerated by adults and children.
                    




















Pharmacology





                            Roxithromycin inhibits protein synthesis by irreversibly binding to the 50s ribosomal subunits thus blocking the transpeptidation or translocation reactions of susceptible organisms resulting in stunted cell growth.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adult dose
: The usual dose for adults is one 300 mg tablet once daily or one 150 mg tablet twice a day for at least two days after resolution of symptoms, a normal course of therapy is between 5 and 10 days. Roxithromycin is best administered on empty stomach. In severe hepatic impairment the dose is 150 mg once daily.
Pediatric dose
: The dose for children is 2.5 to 5 mg/kg body weight twice a day. The following general guidelines can be followed




6 to 11 Kg
: 25 mg Roxithromycin 12 hourly.


12 to 23 Kg
: 50 mg Roxithromycin 12 hourly.


24 to 40 Kg
: 100 mg Roxithromycin 12 hourly.



A normal course of therapy is between 5 and 10 days.

Interaction





                            A-Rox does not have any affinity for cytochrome P-450 binding sites and thus is unlikely to produce drug interaction mediated by this enzymatic system. A-Rox shows mild interaction with theophylline though this has not been found to produce clinically relevant effects. Alteration in the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine or warfarin has not been found. Antacids, H2- receptor antagonists and food has no effect on the absorption of A-Rox.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Roxithromycin should not be administered simultaneously with ergotamine or its derivatives as it may provoke arterial spasm and severe ischaemia.
                    










Side Effects





                            A-Rox is well tolerated by patients of all age groups. Less than 4% of treated patients complain of side effects mainly nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and hypersensitivity rash. Other side effects reported include vomiting, dizziness, headache, pruritus, dyspepsia, flatulence, tinnitus, vertigo and constipation. These are in general minor and do not necessitate withdrawal of therapy.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            The safety of Roxithromycin in pregnancy has not been established. It appears in breast milk in small amounts and dose not produce adverse effects in the breast fed infant.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            A-Rox should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to the drug. In patients with hepatic diseases the dose of A-Rox should not exceed 150 mg twice a day.

Pharmacology





                            Atorvastatin is a selective inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. This enzyme is the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface for enhanced uptake and catabolism of LDL.
Absorption
: Atorvastatin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to Atorvastatin dose. The absolute bioavailability of Atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14% and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30%.
Distribution
: Mean volume of distribution of Atorvastatin is approximately 381 liters. Atorvastatin is 98% bound to plasma proteins. A blood/plasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, Atorvastatin is likely to be secreted in human milk.
Metabolism
: Atorvastatin is extensively metabolized to ortho- and parahydroxylated derivatives and various beta-oxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of Atorvastatin. Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of Atorvastatin metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of Atorvastatin in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozymes. In animals, the ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation.
Excretion
: Atorvastatin and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic and/or extra-hepatic metabolism; however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination half-life of Atorvastatin in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the half-life of inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2% of a dose of Atorvastatin is recovered in urine following oral administration.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            Primary hypercholesterolaemia and combined hyperlipidaemia-




Adults
: Usually 10 mg once daily; if necessary, may be increased at intervals of at least 4 weeks to max. 80 mg once daily.


Child (10-18 years)
: Initially 10 mg once daily, increased if necessary at intervals of at least 4 weeks to usual max. 20 mg once daily.



Familial hypercholesterolaemia-




Adults
: Initially 10 mg daily, increased at intervals of at least 4 weeks to 40 mg once daily; if necessary, further increased to max. 80 mg once daily (or 40 mg once daily combined with anion-exchange resin in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia).


Child (10-18 years)
: Initially 10 mg once daily, increased if necessary at intervals of at least 4 weeks to usual max. 80 mg once daily.



Prevention of cardiovascular events-




Adults
: Initially 10 mg once daily adjusted according to response.




Another guideline
: 
The patient should be placed on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet before receiving Atorvastatin and should continue on this diet during treatment with Atorvastatin. The recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of Atorvastatin is 10 to 80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. After initiation of Atorvastatin lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly.
In hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10-17 years of age) the recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.

Interaction





                            The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs of this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, niacin (nicotinic acid), erythromycin, azole antifungals.
Antacid
: When atorvastatin and antacid suspension were coadministered, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 35%. However, LDL-C reduction was not altered.
Colestipol
: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 25% when colestipol and atorvastatin were coadministered. However, LDL-C reduction was greater when atorvastatin and colestipol were coadministered than when either drug was given alone.
Digoxin
: When multiple doses of atorvastatin and digoxin were coadministered, steady-state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20%. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately.
Erythromycin
: In healthy individuals, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin increased approximately 40% with coadministration of atorvastatin and erythromycin, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4.
Oral Contraceptives
: Coadministration of atorvastatin and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by approximately 30% and 20%. These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.
Warfarin
: A-Statin had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Atorvastatin should not be used in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Atorvastatin is contraindicated in active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases. It is also contraindicated in patient with history of serious adverse reaction to prior administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.
                    










Side Effects





                            A-Statin is generally well-tolerated. The most frequent side effects related to A-Statin are constipation, flatulence, dyspepsia, abdominal pain. Other side effects includes infection, headache, back pain, rash, asthenia, arthralgia, myalgia.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation






Pregnancy
: Atorvastatin is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant women has not been established. No controlled clinical trials with atorvastatin have been conducted in pregnant women. Rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been received. Animal studies have shown toxicity to reproduction. Maternal treatment with atorvastatin may reduce the fetal levels of mevalonate which is a precursor of cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin should not be used in women who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant or suspect they are pregnant. Treatment with atorvastatin should be suspended for the duration of pregnancy or until it has been determined that the woman is not pregnant
Lactation
: It is not known whether atorvastatin or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. In rats, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and its active metabolites are similar to those in milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, women taking atorvastatin should not breastfeed their infants. Atorvastatin is contraindicated during breastfeeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Liver effects: Liver function tests should be performed before the initiation of treatment and periodically thereafter. A-Statin should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol or have a history of liver disease. A-Statin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Geriatric
: Plasma concentrations of A-Statin are higher (approximately 40% for Cmax and 30% for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDL-lowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults.
Pediatric
: Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available.
Gender
: There is no clinically significant difference in LDL-C reduction with A-Statin between men and women.
Renal Insufficiency
: Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDL-C reduction of A-Statin; thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary.
Hemodialysis
: Hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of A-Statin since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins.
Hepatic Insufficiency
: In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of A-Statin are markedly increased.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Specific treatment is not available for atorvastatin overdose. The patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted, as required. Liver function tests should be performed and serum CK levels should be monitored. Due to extensive atorvastatin binding to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance atorvastatin clearance.

Pharmacology





                            Tetracycline has its main mechanism of action on protein synthesis, and an energy-dependent active transport system pumps the drug through the inner cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria. Once inside the bacterial cell, Tetracycline binds specifically to the 30s ribosomes and inhibit bacterial protein synthesis.
Many Gram positive aerobic Cocci are susceptible, but many strains of staphylococci, streptococci and even some pneumococci are resistant to Tetracycline. Thus, tetracycline is not the drug of choice in infections due to gram positive aerobes.
Pseudomonas and many Enterobacteriaceae are resistant. Urinary concentrations are adequate for some community - acquired E. coli and consequently, Tetracycline is still used in uncomplicated initial UTIs. Tetracycline is also active against and is the drug of choice for Brucella species, Calymmatobacterium granulomatis, Vibrio cholerae and V. vulnificus.
Tetracycline is also active against anaerobic species of bacteria and since concentrations of the drug are quite high in the gastrointestinal contents, the enteric flora are usually altered by the drug.
Tetracycline is incompletely absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract, about 60 to 80% of a dose of tetracycline usually being available. It is widely distributed through the body tissues and fluids.
Tetracycline has a half-life of about 12 hours. It is excreted in the urine and in the faeces.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            The usual adult oral dosage of Tetracycline is 1-2 g daily given in 2-4 divided doses. The usual oral dosage of Tetracycline for children older than 8 years of age in 25-50 mg/kg daily given in 2-4 divided doses. Alternatively some clinicians recommended that children should receive 0.6-1.2 g/m2 daily.
Tetracycline should be taken preferably one hour before or 2 hours after meals.
Some specific indications along with some information on dosage is given below:
Acne vulgaris
: 250 mg four times daily or 500 mg 12 hourly for 1 week; 125-250 mg for several weeks or months. Duration of therapy is determined by individual progress
Acute staphylococcal infections
: 1-2 g daily in divided doses for 10-14 days
Acute streptococcal infections
: 1-2 g daily in divided doses for 10 days. Prolonged therapy is needed to avoid risk of rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis
Amoebiasis
: 1 g daily in four divided doses or 500 mg 12 hourly for 7 days. Given in association with amoebicidal agents
Brucellosis
: 500 mg four times daily plus 1 g streptomycin twice daily for 1 week ; then 500 mg four times daily (no streptomycin) for 1 week. Prolonged therapy is necessary to avoid relapse
Subacute bacterial endocarditis
: 1-2 g daily in divided doses for 6 weeks. Usually given in combination with a bactericidal agent
Syphilis
: Total 30-40 g given in divided doses over 10-15 days. Serology and spinal fluid examination should follow the administration of tetracycline

Interaction





                            Impaired absorption with antacids containing divalent and trivalent cations (e.g. Al, Ca, Mg), Fe, Zn and Na bicarbonate preparations, kaolin-pectin, bismuth subsalicylate, sucralfate, strontium ranelate, colestipol and colestyramine. May interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin. May potentiate the effect of anticoagulants. May decrease efficacy of oral contraceptives. Nephrotoxic effects may be exacerbated by diuretics or other nephrotoxic drugs. May increase the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin and sulfonylureas in patients with DM. May increase toxic effects of ergot alkaloids and methotrexate.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Tetracycline Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to any of the member of tetracycline groups, since cross-sensitivity may occur Tetracycline Hydrochloride should be avoided in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Tetracycline Hydrochloride is considered to be contraindicated in renal impairment, particularly if severe ; if it must be given, doses should be reduced.
                    










Side Effects






Teeth and bone
: A-Tetra can cause depression of bone growth, permanent graybrown discoloration of the teeth and enamel hypoplasia when given during tooth development (i.e. during the later half of pregnancy, during infancy and in childhood).
Hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, urticaria and rashes are uncommon. Photosensitivity reactions consisting of a red rash on areas exposed to intense sunlight can occur with A-Tetra.
Gastrointestinal effects
: Epigastric distress and nausea are commonly seen after oral administration, and these symptoms are somewhat dose related. Vomiting can occur.
Accentuated prerenal azotemia
: A-Tetra appears to aggravate pre-existing renal failure by inhibiting protein synthesis, which increases the azotemia from amino acid metabolism.
Superinfections with oral and anogenital candidiasis are relatively common in patients taking A-Tetra.
Esophageal ulcerations
: In most cases, the patients were taking the capsules with little or no fluid before going to bed. To help minimize this, oral doses should be given with adequate amounts of fluid.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Tetracycline should not be used during pregnancy because of the risk of hypertoxicity in the mother as well as the effects on the developing foetus. Use in pregnancy potentially during breast-feeding and in children up to the age of 8, or some authorise say 12 years, may result in impaired bone growth and permanent discoloration of the child's teeth.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care should be taken if A-Tetra is given to patients with impaired liver function and high doses should be avoided. Potentiality hepatotoxic drugs (including erythromycin, chloramphenicol, isoniazide and sulphonamides) should not be given concomitantly.

Composition





                            Each enteric film-coated tablet contains 325 mg of Pancreatin BP that provides not less than the following enzymatic activity-




Amylase 7800 units


Protease 455 units


Lipase 6500 units




































Pharmacology





                            Pancreatin is a preparation of Pancreatin, an extract from mammalian pancreas containing enzymes with Amylase, Protease and Lipase activity. It is designed to disintegrate in the alkaline medium of the duodenum where it releases the active enzyme components of Pancreatin (Amylase, Protease and Lipase). Amylase hydrolyzes dietary starch to yield maltose, maltoriose and a-dextrin. Protease cleaves peptide bonds in the center of proteins and polypeptides and forms amino acids and oligopeptides. Lipase hydrolyzes dietary triglycerides forming two molecules of fatty acid and a molecule of beta-monoglyceride. It converts not less than 25 times its weight of starch into soluble carbohydrates and not less than 25 times its weight of casein into proteoses within 5 mins, (equivalent to 150 times in 30 mins).
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            2-3 tablets to be swallowed whole with little water immediately after or during meal. Or as directed by the physician

Interaction





                            Alkaline media will rupture the enteric coating. As such to prevent bursting out of the content in the stomach A-Zyme should not be used concurrently with antacid.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Pancreatin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug.
                    










Side Effects





                            The most frequent side effects are gastrointestinal including nausea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort. Buccal and perianal soreness may occur, particularly in infants. Hypersensitivity reactions manifested by sneezing, lacrimation or skin rashes have been reported.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pancreatin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Pancreatin is administered to a nursing mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Patients known to be allergic to animal protein should be treated with caution.

Composition






Each box
 
contains 2 blister strips
.




One strip contains 1 tablet of Mifepristone INN 200 mg
.


Another strip contains 4 tablets of Misoprostol USP 200 microgram each.




































Pharmacology





                            Mifepristone: Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid with anti-progestational activity results from competitive interaction with progesterone at progesterone-receptor sites. Based on studies with various oral doses in several animal species, the compound inhibits the activity of endogenous or exogenous progesterone and the Menstrual Regulation (MR) results. During pregnancy, the compound sensitizes the myometrium to the contraction-inducing activity of prostaglandins.
Misoprostol: Misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1. It causes myometrial contraction by interacting with specific receptors on myometrial cells. This interaction results in a change in calcium concentration, thereby initiating muscle contraction. By interacting with prostaglandin receptors, Misoprostol causes the cervix to soften and the uterus to contract, resulting in the expulsion of the uterine contents.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            This can only be prescribed by qualified medical professionals who are able to assess the gestational age of an embryo and to diagnose ectopic pregnancies. The qualified medical professionals must also be able to provide surgical Intervention/MVA (Manual Vaccum Aspiration) in cases of incomplete abortion or severe bleeding or have made plans to provide such care through others and be able to assure patient access to medical facilities equipped to provide blood transfusions and resuscitation, if necessary.
Day 1 (First visit)
: Mifepristone administration: One tablet of Mifepristone (200 mg) is taken in a single oral dose under the supervision of a qualified medical professional in a clinic, medical office or hospital.
Day 2 (Second visit)
: Misoprostol administration: 24-48 hours after ingesting the Mifepristone tablet, the patient takes four 200 microgram tablets (800 micrograms) of Misoprostol buccally or sublingually. Misoprostol tablets can be administered by the patient herself (place two tablets on each side of cheeck & gum or under the tongue). She should wait for 30 minutes. During the period immediately following the administration of Misoprostol, the patient may need medication for cramps or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient should be given instructions on what to do if significant discomfort, excessive bleeding or other adverse reactions occur and should be given a phone number to call if she has questions following the administration of Misoprostol. 
Day 10 to 14 (Third visit)
: Post-treatment examination: Patients must return to the clinic, medical office or hospital within 10 to 14 days after the administration of mifepristone. This visit is very important to confirm by clinical examination or ultrasonographic scan that a complete termination of pregnancy has occurred. 
Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at this visit have a risk of fetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/termination of pregnancy failures.

Interaction





                            Mifepristone: Although specific drug or food interactions with Mifepristone have not been studied, on the basis of AB Kit's metabolism by CYP 3A4, it is possible that Ketoconazole, Itraconazole, Erythromycin and grapefruit juice may inhibit its metabolism (increasing serum levels of mifepristone).
Misoprostol: Misoprostol has not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption,blood levels and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Administration of Mifepristone is contraindicated in patients with any one of the following conditions: History of allergy or known hypersensitivity to Mifepristone, Misoprostol or other prostaglandin, confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy or undiagnosed adnexal mass (the treatment procedure will not be effective to terminate an ectopic pregnancy), IUD in place, chronic adrenal failure, haemorrhagic disorders or concurrent anticoagulant therapy, inherited porphyria, If a patient does not have adequate access to medical facilities equipped to provide emergency treatment of incomplete process, blood transfusions and emergency resuscitation during the period from the first visit until discharged by the administering physician.
                    










Side Effects





                            Mifepristone: The treatment procedure is designed to induce vaginal bleeding and uterine cramping necessary for Menstrual Regulation (MR). Commonly reported side effects were nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Pelvic pain, fainting, headache, dizziness, and asthenia occurred rarely.
Misoprostol: Gastro-intestinal side-effects like diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, dyspepsia, headache, vomiting and constipation, shivering, hyperthermia, dizziness, pain due to uterine contractions, severe vaginal bleeding, shock, pelvic pain, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy and/or salpingo-oophorectomy).
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy- 
Mifepristone
: is indicated for Menstrual Regulation (MR) (through 63 days pregnancy) and has no other approved indication for use during pregnancy. Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at the last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR) treatment failures.
Lactation- 




Mifepristone
: It is not known whether Mifepristone is excreted through human milk. Many hormones with a similar chemical structure, however, are excreted in breast milk. Since the effects of Mifepristone on infants are unknown, breast-feeding women should consult with their doctor to decide if they should discard their breast milk for a few days following administration of the medications.


Misoprostol
: Although it is not known whether Misoprostol or Misoprostol is excreted through human milk, Misoprostol should not be administered to nursing mothers because the potential excretion of misoprostol acid could cause diarrhoea in nursing infants.












Precautions & Warnings





                            The patient should not give combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol to anyone else. The combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, it may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she is or were to become pregnant. Any Intra Uterine Device [IUD] should be removed before treatment with Mifepristone begins. Menstrual Regulation (MR) by surgery is recommended in cases when combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol fails to cause Menstrual Regulation (MR). Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/ termination of pregnancy failures.
                    








Use in Special Populations





                            Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic disease should receive a decreased dose of Misoprostol.
Use in Patients with Renal Impairment: No routine dosage adjustment is recommended of Misoprostol in older patients or patients with renal impairment but the dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Mifepristone: No serious adverse reactions were reported in tolerance studies in healthy nonpregnant female and healthy male subjects where Mifepristone was administered in single doses greater than threefold of 600mg for Menstrual Regulation (MR). If a patient ingests a massive overdose, she should be observed closely for signs of adrenal failure.
Misoprostol: Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are a sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fever, palpitations, hypotension or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. However, because Misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be the appropriate treatment for overdosage.

Description





                            AB-DS is a benzimidazole anthelmintic, active against most nematodes and some cestodes. It is used in the treatment of intestinal nematode infections and in higher doses in the treatment of hydatid disease. AB-DS exhibits vermicidal, ovicidal, and larvicidal activity. The principal mode of action of AB-DS is its inhibitory effect on tubulin polymerization, which results in the loss of cytoplasmic microtubules.
                    




















Pharmacology





                            Albendazole is a broad spectrum anthelmintic. Albendazole exhibits vermicidal, ovicidal and larvicidal activities. The drug is thought to exert its anthelmintic effect by blocking glucose uptake in the susceptible helminths, thereby depleting the energy level until it becomes inadequate for survival. Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adults & children over 2 years
: 




400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) as a single dose in cases of Enterobius vermicularis, Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides, Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus.


In cases of strongyloidiasis or taeniasis, 400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) daily should be given for 3 consecutive days. If the patient is not cured on follow-up after three weeks, a second course of treatment is indicated. 




Children of 1-2 years
: Recommended dose is a single dose of 200 mg (5 ml suspension).
Children under 1 year
: Not recommended.
In Hydatid disease (Echinococcosis)
: 




Albendazole is given by mouth with meals in a dose of 400 mg twice daily for 28 days for patients weighing over 60 kg.


A dose of 15 mg/kg body weight daily in two divided doses (to a maximum total daily dose of 800 mg) is used for patients weighing less than 60 kg.


For cystic echinococcosis, the 28 days course may be repeated after 14 days without treatment, to a total of 3 treatment cycles.


For alveolar echinococcosis, cycles of 28 days of treatment followed by 14 days without treatment, may need to continue for months or years.


In giardiasis, 400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) once daily for five days is used.

Concurrent disease
: There is no evidence to suggest that dose should be altered in renal, hepatic or cardiac failure.
                    










Side Effects





                            Gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, dizziness, changes in liver enzymes, rarely reversible alopecia; rash, fever, blood disorders including leucopenia and pancytopenia reported; allergic shock if cyst leakage; convulsion and meningism in cerebral disease.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            US FDA Pregnancy category of Albendazole is C. So, Albendazole should be avoided in pregnancy and lactation unless the potential benefits to the other outweigh the possible risks to the fetus.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Blood counts and liver function tests before treatment and twice during each cycle; breastfeeding; exclude pregnancy before starting treatment.

Pharmacology





                            Cephradine is a semisynthetic broad spectrum bactericidal antibiotic, it is active against infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Both penicillinase producing and nonproducing staphylococci are sensitive to Cephradine. The main site of action of Cephradine is the cell wall of bacteria. Cell wall of sensitive organism contains peptidoglycan. Cephradine inhibits cross-linking process and as a result cell wall with many pores are formed, thus lysis of bacteria occur due to external osmotic pressure.

Interaction





                            The concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides with Cefradine may increase the risk of kidney damage. Diuretics (e.g. frusemide, ethacrynic acid) and probenecid enhanced the possibility of renal toxicity.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Cephradine should not be used in patients with known or suspected hypersensitivity to cephalosporins.
                    










Side Effects





                            Limited essentially to gastro-intestinal disturbances and on occasions to hypersensitivity phenomena. The latter are more likely to occur in individuals, who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity and thos with a history of allergy, asthma, hay fever or urticaria. Skin reactions have occasionally been reported. Rare- Glossitis, heartburn, dizziness, tightness in the chest, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vaginitis, candida overgrowth. Skin and hypersensitivity reactions include urticaria, skin rashes, joint pains, oedema.




Blood and lymphatic system disorders- Unknown: blood disorders (including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anaemia and haemolytic anaemia)


Immune system disorders- Unknown: Fever, serum sickness like reactions, anaphylaxis


Psychiatric disorders- Unknown: Confusion, sleep disturbances


Nervous system disorders- Unknown: hyperactivity, hypertonia, dizziness, nervousness; Rarely: Headache


Hepatobiliary disorders- Frequency unknown: Liver, enzyme disturbances, transient hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice


Renal and urinary disorders- Unknown: Reversible interstitial nephritis


Investigations- Unknown: Elevation of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase.














Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Although animal studies have not demonstrated any teratogenicity, safety in pregnancy has not been established. Cephradine is excreted in breast milk and should be used with caution in lactating mothers. Since the medicine may cause dizziness, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles.
                    








Precautions & Warnings








Prolonged use of an anti-infective may result in the development of superinfection due to the emergence of resistant organisms.


Abac should be administered with care to patients hypersensitive to penicillins because of the risk of cross-sensitivity between beta-lactam antibiotics.


Cephalosporin antibiotics may cause a positive result in Coombs’ testing. When Coombs testing is performed on neonates whose mothers received cephalosporins prior to labour, it should be noted that a positive result may be due to the drug.


Abac may cause a false positive urine glucose result when Benedict’s or Fehling’s solutions or tablets such as Clinitest are used in the testing. This does not occur with enzyme-based tests (e.g. Clinistix, Diastix).


Dosage adjustment is necessary in renal impairment.


Abac contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.












Use in Special Populations





                            Renal Impairment: The following doses are recommended (based on 500 mg every 6 hours) for patients not on haemodialysis:




CrCl: >20 ml/min: 500 mg every 6 hours


CrCl: 5-20 ml/min: 250 mg every 6 hours


CrCl: <5 ml/min: 250 mg every 50-70 hours.



Recommendations for patients on chronic, intermittent haemodialysis:




250 mg at the start of haemodialysis


250 mg 6 to 12 hours after the start


250 mg 36 to 48 hours after the start


250 mg at the start of the next haemodialysis session if more than 30 hours have elapsed since the last dose.



Additional Information for all patients Regardless of patient age or weight, higher doses of up to 1 gm four times daily may be required for infections which are chronic or severe. Treatment should continue for at least 2 to 3 days after symptoms have resolved or bacteria have been eradicated. To reduce the possibility of rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis resulting from infections with haemolytic streptococci, treatment should be continued for at least 10 days. Throughout treatment of chronic urinary tract infections and for several months thereafter, regular bacteriological and clinical monitoring is required. 
Doses below those recommended above should not be prescribed. Paediatric dosages should not exceed those specified for adults, regardless of severity of infection. It may be necessary to continue Abac therapy for several weeks in persistent infections. Patients may be transferred from intramuscular/intravenous Abac therapy to oral treatment at the same dosage level.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            The symptoms of Sefrad overdose are non-specific and are generally nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and gastric upsets. Treatment is mainly supportive although gastric lavage will be necessary if a large amount has been ingested.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            First generation Cephalosporins
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Abac Suspension should be freshly prepared. Reconstituted Suspension should be used within 7 days if kept at room temperature or within 14 days, if kept in a refrigerator. Abac Injection solutions should be used within 2 hours when kept at room temperature. When stored at 5°C, solutions retain potency for 12 hours. Reconstituted solutions may vary in colour from light to straw yellow; however, this does not affect the potency. Do not use later than the date of expiry. Keep all medicines out of the reach of children. To be dispensed only on the prescription of a registered physician

Pharmacology





                            Cephradine is a semisynthetic broad spectrum bactericidal antibiotic, it is active against infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Both penicillinase producing and nonproducing staphylococci are sensitive to Cephradine. The main site of action of Cephradine is the cell wall of bacteria. Cell wall of sensitive organism contains peptidoglycan. Cephradine inhibits cross-linking process and as a result cell wall with many pores are formed, thus lysis of bacteria occur due to external osmotic pressure.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






For oral administration
-
Adults:




Urinary tract infections: 500mg four times daily or 1g twice daily. Infections which are severe or chronic may necessitate the administration of higher doses. Where complications arise including prostatitis and epididymitis continued intensive treatment is required.


Respiratory tract infections: 250 to 500mg four times daily or 500mg to 1g twice daily, dependent on the site and severity of the infection.


Skin and soft tissue infections: 250 to 500mg four times daily or 500mg to 1g twice daily, again dependent on the site and severity of the infection.



Children:




Total daily dose of 25 to 50mg/kg given in two or four equally divided doses.


Otitis media: Total daily dose of 75 to 100mg/kg given in divided doses 6 to 12 hourly.


Maximum daily dosage: 4 gm



Elderly: The normal adult dose is appropriate. Patients with impaired renal or hepatic function should be monitored during treatment.
For injectable administration
- 




Adult: The usual dose is 2-4 gm daily in four equally divided doses up to 8 gm daily. For prophylaxis a single preoperative dose of 1-2 gm intramuscularly or intravenously is given.


Children: The dose is 50-100 mg/kg daily in four equally divided doses, up to 300 mg/kg daily in severe infection.

Pharmacology





                            Cefaclor is a second generation cephalosporin antibiotic which has stability against b-lactamase inactivation and possesses a broad spectrum of activity. Cefaclor is active against the following organisms in vitro: Alpha and beta haemolytic Streptococci, Staphylococci; including coagulase-positive, coagulase negative and penicillinase-producing strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A b-haemolytic Streptococci), Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species Haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains. Cefaclor is generally effective in the eradication of Streptococci from the nasopharynx.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Capsule: Adult dose
: The usual dose is 250 mg every 8 hourly. For severe infections or those caused by less susceptible organisms, doses may be doubled with a maximum dosage of 4 g/day. In case of β-hemolytic Streptococcal infections, therapy should be administered for at least 10 days.
Powder for suspension & Pediatric drops: Children
: The usual daily dosage for paediatric patients over 1 month is 20 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 8 hours. In serious infections such as otitis media and infections caused by less susceptible organisms, 40 mg/kg/day are recommended, with a maximum dosage of 1 g/day. Safety and effectiveness of Cefaclor for use in infants less than 1 month of age have not been established.
<1 year (9 kg):




 Powder for suspension
: ½ tsp three times daily


Pediatric drops
: 0.625 ml three times daily



1-5 years (9 kg-18 kg):




 Powder for suspension
: 1 tsp three times daily


Pediatric drops
: 1.25 ml three times daily



Over 5 years:




Powder for suspension
: 2 tsp three times daily




In renal impairment
: Cefaclor may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Dose adjustments for patients with moderate or sever renal impairment are not usually required.
In patients undergoing haemodialysis
: Haemodialysis shortens serum half-life by 25-30%. In patients undergoing haemodialysis, a predialysis loading dose of 250 mg-1 g is recommended. A maintaining dose of 250-500 mg every 6 hourly during interdialytic period may be used.
Geriatric use
: Clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Interaction





                            Abaclor may show a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine with tests that use Benedict's solution, Fehling's solutions. When Abaclor and oral anticoagulants were administered concomitantly there have been reports of increased anticoagulant effect and there have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time, with or without clinical bleeding, in patients receiving Abaclor and anticoagulants (Warfarin) concomitantly. It is recommended that in such patients, regular monitoring of prothrombin time should be considered, with adjustment of dosage if necessary.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Cefaclor is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to the Cephalosporin group of antibiotics.
                    










Side Effects





                            Gastro-intestinal symptoms may occur include diarrhea, nausea and vomiting in some patients receiving Abaclor. As with some penicillins and some other Cephalosporins, transient hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported rarely. Fever, abdominal pain, superinfection, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, hemorrhage, elevated LDH and pancytopenia may occur.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Small amounts of Cefaclor have been detected in mother's milk. The effect on nursing infants is not known. Caution should be exercised when Cefaclor is administered to a nursing woman.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Prescribing Abaclor in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.
Prolonged use of Abaclor may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. As with other β-lactam antibiotics, the renal excretion of Abaclor is inhibited by Probenecid. Antibiotics, including Cephalosporins, should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis.
Before therapy with Abaclor is instituted, careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had previous hypersensitivity reactions to Abaclor, Cephalosporins, Penicillins or other drugs. If Abaclor is to be given to penicillin-sensitive patients, caution should be exercised. Abaclor should be administered cautiously to any patient who has demonstrated some form of allergy, particularly to drugs.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            The toxic symptoms following an overdose of Abaclor may include nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, and diarrhea.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Second generation Cephalosporins
                    








Reconstitution






Powder for Suspension
: Shake the bottle well before mixing the water. To prepare 100 ml suspension, add 62.5 ml (12.5 spoonfuls) of boiled & cooled water in two portions and shake till powder is completely mixed with water. The prepared suspension can be used within 7 days if it is stored at room temperature and 14 days if it is kept in refrigerator.
Pediatric Drops
: Shake the bottle well before mixing the water. To prepare 15 ml pediatric drops, add 10 ml (2 spoonfuls) of boiled & cooled water in two portions and shake till powder is completely mixed with water. The prepared drops can be used within 7 days if it is stored at room temperature and 14 days if it is kept in refrigerator.
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Store at room temperature and protect from light. After reconstitution the suspension can be used within 7 days if kept at room temperature and within 14 days if kept in refrigerator (2-8°C). Always keep the bottle tightly closed.

Pharmacology





                            Cefaclor is a second generation cephalosporin antibiotic which has stability against b-lactamase inactivation and possesses a broad spectrum of activity. Cefaclor is active against the following organisms in vitro: Alpha and beta haemolytic Streptococci, Staphylococci; including coagulase-positive, coagulase negative and penicillinase-producing strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A b-haemolytic Streptococci), Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species Haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains. Cefaclor is generally effective in the eradication of Streptococci from the nasopharynx.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Capsule: Adult dose
: The usual dose is 250 mg every 8 hourly. For severe infections or those caused by less susceptible organisms, doses may be doubled with a maximum dosage of 4 g/day. In case of β-hemolytic Streptococcal infections, therapy should be administered for at least 10 days.
Powder for suspension & Pediatric drops: Children
: The usual daily dosage for paediatric patients over 1 month is 20 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 8 hours. In serious infections such as otitis media and infections caused by less susceptible organisms, 40 mg/kg/day are recommended, with a maximum dosage of 1 g/day. Safety and effectiveness of Cefaclor for use in infants less than 1 month of age have not been established.
<1 year (9 kg):




 Powder for suspension
: ½ tsp three times daily


Pediatric drops
: 0.625 ml three times daily



1-5 years (9 kg-18 kg):




 Powder for suspension
: 1 tsp three times daily


Pediatric drops
: 1.25 ml three times daily



Over 5 years:




Powder for suspension
: 2 tsp three times daily




In renal impairment
: Cefaclor may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Dose adjustments for patients with moderate or sever renal impairment are not usually required.
In patients undergoing haemodialysis
: Haemodialysis shortens serum half-life by 25-30%. In patients undergoing haemodialysis, a predialysis loading dose of 250 mg-1 g is recommended. A maintaining dose of 250-500 mg every 6 hourly during interdialytic period may be used.
Geriatric use
: Clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Interaction





                            Abaclor may show a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine with tests that use Benedict's solution, Fehling's solutions. When Abaclor and oral anticoagulants were administered concomitantly there have been reports of increased anticoagulant effect and there have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time, with or without clinical bleeding, in patients receiving Abaclor and anticoagulants (Warfarin) concomitantly. It is recommended that in such patients, regular monitoring of prothrombin time should be considered, with adjustment of dosage if necessary.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Cefaclor is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to the Cephalosporin group of antibiotics.
                    










Side Effects





                            Gastro-intestinal symptoms may occur include diarrhea, nausea and vomiting in some patients receiving Abaclor. As with some penicillins and some other Cephalosporins, transient hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported rarely. Fever, abdominal pain, superinfection, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, hemorrhage, elevated LDH and pancytopenia may occur.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Small amounts of Cefaclor have been detected in mother's milk. The effect on nursing infants is not known. Caution should be exercised when Cefaclor is administered to a nursing woman.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Prescribing Abaclor in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.
Prolonged use of Abaclor may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. As with other β-lactam antibiotics, the renal excretion of Abaclor is inhibited by Probenecid. Antibiotics, including Cephalosporins, should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis.
Before therapy with Abaclor is instituted, careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had previous hypersensitivity reactions to Abaclor, Cephalosporins, Penicillins or other drugs. If Abaclor is to be given to penicillin-sensitive patients, caution should be exercised. Abaclor should be administered cautiously to any patient who has demonstrated some form of allergy, particularly to drugs.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            The toxic symptoms following an overdose of Abaclor may include nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, and diarrhea.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Second generation Cephalosporins
                    








Reconstitution






Powder for Suspension
: Shake the bottle well before mixing the water. To prepare 100 ml suspension, add 62.5 ml (12.5 spoonfuls) of boiled & cooled water in two portions and shake till powder is completely mixed with water. The prepared suspension can be used within 7 days if it is stored at room temperature and 14 days if it is kept in refrigerator.
Pediatric Drops
: Shake the bottle well before mixing the water. To prepare 15 ml pediatric drops, add 10 ml (2 spoonfuls) of boiled & cooled water in two portions and shake till powder is completely mixed with water. The prepared drops can be used within 7 days if it is stored at room temperature and 14 days if it is kept in refrigerator.

Indications





                            Abacten is indicated for infections (caused by susceptible organisms) in lower respiratory tract infections including bronchitis and pneumonia, in upper respiratory tract infections including sinusitis and pharyngitis/tonsillitis, in otitis media, and in skin and soft tissue infections. In sexually transmitted diseases in men and women, Abacten is indicated in the treatment of non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis.

Pharmacology





                            Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility.
Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.
Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:




Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms
: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes


Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms
: Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae


Other microorganisms
: Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Betalactamase production should have no effect on azithromycin activity.


Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms
: Streptococci (Groups C,F,G), Viridans group streptococci


Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms
: Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila


Anaerobic microorganisms
: Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella bivia




























Dosage






Oral
-
Adult
: 500 mg once daily orally for 3 days or 500 mg once on day 1, then 250 mg once on days 2-5 for 4 days. For sexually transmitted diseases caused by Chlamydia trachomatis in adults, the dose is 1 gm given as a single dose or 500 mg once on day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily for next 2 days may also be given.
Children
:




10 mg/kg body weight once daily for 3 days for child over 6 months


200 mg (1 teaspoonful) for 3 days if body weight is 15-25 kg


300 mg (1½ teaspoonfuls) for 3 days if body weight is 26-35 kg; 400 mg (2 teaspoonfuls) for 3 days if body weight is 36-45 kg.


In typhoid fever, 500 mg (2½ teaspoonfuls) once daily for 7-10 days is given.




Azithromycin Injection (For IV Infusion only)
: The recommended dose of Azithromycin for injection for the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia due to the indicated organisms is:




500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for at least two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by Azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 500 mg, administered as two 250-mg tablets to complete a 7 to 10-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response.


The recommended dose of Azithromycin for the treatment of adult patients with pelvic inflammatory disease due to the indicated organisms is: 500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for one or two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by Azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 250 mg to complete a 7-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response. If anaerobic microorganisms are suspected of contributing to the infection, an antimicrobial agent with anaerobic activity should be administered in combination with Azithromycin.


Safety and effectiveness of azithromycin for injection in children or adolescents under 16 years have not been established.

Interaction






Antacid
: In patients receiving azithromycin and antacids, azithromycin should be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the antacid. Carbamazepine: In a pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers, no significant effect was observed on the plasma levels of carbamazepine or its active metabolite. 
Cyclosporin
: Some of the related macrolide antibiotics interfere with the metabolism of cyclosporin. In the absence of conclusive data from pharmacokinetic studies or clinical data investigating potential interactions between azithromycin and cyclosporine, caution should be exercised before co-administration of these two drugs. If coadministrations is necessary, cyclosporin levels should be monitored and the dose adjusted accordingly. 
Digoxin
: Some of the macrolide antibiotics have been reported to impair the metabolism of digoxin (in the gut) in some patients. Therefore, in patients receiving concomitant azithromycin and digoxin the possibility of raised digoxin levels should be borne in mind and digoxin levels monitored. 
Ergot derivatives
: Because of the theoretical possibility of ergotism, azithromycin and ergot derivatives should not be co-administered. 
Methylprednisolone
: In a pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers, azithromycin had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of methylprednisolone. 
Theophylline
: There is no evidence of any pharmacokinetic interaction when azithromycin and theophylline are co-administered to healthy volunteers. In general, however, theophylline levels should be monitored. 
Warfarin
: In a pharmacodynamic interaction study, azithromycin did not alter the anticoagulant effect of a single 15 mg dose of warfarin administered to healthy volunteers. Abacten and warfarin may be co-administered, but monitoring of the prothrombin time should be continued as routinely performed. 
Terfenadine
: Abacten did not affect the pharmacokinetics of terfenadine administered at the recommended dose of 60 mg every 12 hours. Addition of azithromycin did not result in any significant changes in cardiac repolarisation (QTc interval) measured during the steady state dosing of terfenadine.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Azithromycin Dihydrate is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to Azithromycin or any other macrolide antibiotic. Co-administration of ergot derivatives and Azithromycin is contraindicated. Azithromycin is contraindicated in patients with hepatic diseases.
                    










Side Effects





                            Abacten is well tolerated with a low incidence of side-effects. Most side-effects observed were mild to moderate in severity. The majority of side-effects were gastrointestinal in origin with nauseas, abdominal discomfort (pain/cramps), vomiting, flatulence, diarrhoea and loose stools being occasionally observed. Allergic reactions such as rash or photosensitivity have occurred and there have also been rare reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions. Reversible elevations in liver transaminases have been seen with a frequency similar to the comparative macrolides and penicillins used in clinical trials. Rarely, cases of cholestatic jaundice have been observed. Transient mild reductions in neutrofil counts have occasionally been observed in clinical trials, although a causal relationship to azithromycin has not been established. Hearing impairment: In investigational studies where higher doses were used for prolonged periods of time, reversible hearing impairment was seen in some patients.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy Category of Azithromycin Dihydrate is B. Animal reproduction studies have demonstrated that Azithromycin has no evidence of harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Since animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if adequate alternatives are not available. It is not known whether Azithromycin is secreted in breast milk. So, caution should be exercised when Azithromycin is administered to nursing women.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            As with erythromycin and other macrolides, rare serious allergic reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylaxis, has been reported. Some of these reactions with azithromycin have resulted in recurrent symptoms and required a long period of observation and treatment.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Use in renal impairment
: No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance >40 ml/min), but there are no data regarding azithromycin in patients with more severe renal impairment, thus caution should be exercised in using azithromycin in these patients.
Use in hepatic impairment
: As the liver is the principal route of excretion of azithromycin, it should not be used in patients with hepatic disease.
Effects on ability to drive and use machines
: There is no evidence to suggest that azithromycin may have an effect on a patient’s ability to drive or operate machinery.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            There is no data on overdosage with Abacten. Typical symptoms of overdosage with macrolide antibiotics include hearing loss, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Gastric lavage and general supportive measures are indicated.
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Keep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.

Pharmacology





                            Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility.
Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.
Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:




Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms
: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes


Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms
: Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae


Other microorganisms
: Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Betalactamase production should have no effect on azithromycin activity.


Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms
: Streptococci (Groups C,F,G), Viridans group streptococci


Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms
: Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila


Anaerobic microorganisms
: Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella bivia




























Dosage






Oral
-
Adult
: 500 mg once daily orally for 3 days or 500 mg once on day 1, then 250 mg once on days 2-5 for 4 days. For sexually transmitted diseases caused by Chlamydia trachomatis in adults, the dose is 1 gm given as a single dose or 500 mg once on day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily for next 2 days may also be given.
Children
:




10 mg/kg body weight once daily for 3 days for child over 6 months


200 mg (1 teaspoonful) for 3 days if body weight is 15-25 kg


300 mg (1½ teaspoonfuls) for 3 days if body weight is 26-35 kg; 400 mg (2 teaspoonfuls) for 3 days if body weight is 36-45 kg.


In typhoid fever, 500 mg (2½ teaspoonfuls) once daily for 7-10 days is given.




Azithromycin Injection (For IV Infusion only)
: The recommended dose of Azithromycin for injection for the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia due to the indicated organisms is:




500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for at least two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by Azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 500 mg, administered as two 250-mg tablets to complete a 7 to 10-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response.


The recommended dose of Azithromycin for the treatment of adult patients with pelvic inflammatory disease due to the indicated organisms is: 500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for one or two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by Azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 250 mg to complete a 7-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response. If anaerobic microorganisms are suspected of contributing to the infection, an antimicrobial agent with anaerobic activity should be administered in combination with Azithromycin.


Safety and effectiveness of azithromycin for injection in children or adolescents under 16 years have not been established.

Pharmacology





                            Insulin Glargine is a sterile solution of insulin glargine for use as a subcutaneous injection. Insulin glargine is a recombinant human insulin analogue that is a long-acting (up to 24-hour duration of action), parenteral blood glucose lowering agent. Insulin Glargine is produced by recombinant DNA technology. Primary function of insulin glargine is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogues lower blood glucose by stimulation peripheral glucose uptake, primarily by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis.
                    
























Dosage





                            Insulin Glargine exhibits a relatively constant glucose-lowering profile over 24 hours that permits once-daily dosing. Potency of insulin glargine is approximately the same as human insulin.
Insulin Glargine is recommended for once daily subcutaneous administration & may be administered at any time during the day. However, once started should be administered at the same time every day. The dose of Insulin Glargine must be individualized based on clinical response. Blood glucose monitoring is essential in all patients with diabetes. In patients with type 1 diabetes, Insulin Glargine must be used in regimens with short-acting insulin. Insulin Glargine is not recommended for intravenous administration. Intravenous administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycemia.
Initiation of Insulin Glargine therapy: 




The recommended starting dose of Insulin Glargine in patients with type 1 diabetes should be approximately one-third of the total daily insulin requirements. Short-acting, premeal insulin should be used to satisfy the remainder of the daily insulin requirements.


The recommended starting dose of Insulin Glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not currently treated with insulin is 10 units (or 0.2 Units/kg) once daily, which should subsequently be adjusted to the patient's needs.




Converting to Insulin Glargine from other insulin therapies: 
If changing from a treatment regimen with an intermediate-or long-acting insulin to a regimen with Insulin Glargine , the amount and timing of shorter-acting insulins and doses of any oral anti-diabetic drugs may need to be adjusted.




If transferring patients from once-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin Glargine , the recommended initial Insulin Glargine dose is the same as the dose of NPH that is being discontinued.


If transferring patients from twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin Glargine , the recommended initial Insulin Glargine dose is 80% of the total NPH dose that is being discontinued.

Administration





                            Insulin Glargine should be injected subcutaneously once daily at any time of day, but at the same time everyday.
Cartridge: 




Insert the Insulin Glargine cartridge into the pen correctly and equip the needle. Gently turn the pen upside down for 8-10 times until the insulin in the cartridge becomes uniformly mixed.


Adjust the dosage button to get correct dose. After removal of the needle cap and discharge air bubbles in the cartridge, it is ready to be injected. In order to avoid cross contamination, do not let the needle touch anything during the process of preparation.



Vial:




Firstly, clean your hands. Shake or rotate the vial gently to mix the solution uniformly and check if the insulin has the normal appearance.


If using a new Insulin Glargine bottle then flip off the plastic protective cap and wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab.


Draw air into your syringe equal to the amount of Insulin Glargine needed. Puncture the needle into the vial and inject the air.


Turn the bottle and syringe upside down. Withdraw correct dose of Insulin Glargine into the syringe. Before pulling out the needle, check if there are any bubbles remain in the syringe.


If so, put the syringe upright and tap the syringe to discharge the air bubbles.




Injection Site
: Choose the area where skin is less tight, such as the upper arm, thigh, buttock and abdomen, etc. To avoid tissue damage, choose a site for each injection that is at least 1 cm from the previous injection site.
Injection Method
: Cleanse the skin with alcohol where the injection is to be made. Put the needle in such a position as to form 45° angle with the skin. Puncture the needle into skin and inject insulin. Then pull the needle out and apply gentle pressure over the injected site for several seconds. Do not rub the injection site.

Interaction





                            A number of drugs affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment. 
The following substances may reduce the Abasaglar as well as Abasaglar requirements
: Oral anti-diabetic products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.
The following substances may increase the Abasaglar as well as Abasaglar requirements
: Thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, beta-sympathomimetics, growth hormone and danazol. Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Insulin glargine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to insulin glargine or any of its excipients.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of Abasaglar are hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reaction, lipodystrophy, pruritus, and rash.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy category C. Insulin glargine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is unknown whether insulin glargine is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs, including human insulin, are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Insulin glargine is administered to a nursing woman. Lactating women may require adjustments in insulin dose & diet.
                    








Precautions & Warnings






Dose adjustment and monitoring
: Blood glucose should be monitored in all patients treated with insulin. Abasaglar regimens should be modified cautiously and only under medical supervision.
Administration
: Abasaglar must not be diluted or mixed with any other insulin or solution. It should not be administered subcutaneously via an insulin pump or intravenously because severe hypoglycemia can occur.
Renal or hepatic impairment
: Reduction in the Abasaglardose may require in these cases.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Abasaglar overdose may result in hypoglycemia. Mild episodes of hypoglycemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Severe hypoglycemia may be treated with parenteral glucose or injections of glucagon. Adjustments in drug dosage, meal patterns, or exercise may be needed.

Antioxidant vitamins are used in a wide range of conditions where free radical damage is playing a role. Antioxidant vitamin combination is used in the prevention of coronary heart diseases, certain types of cancer, aging as well as free radical damage caused by excessive exercise, illness, certain medications, air pollution, smoke, radiation and pesticides. The main role of the antioxidant vitamins is as follows:
β carotene prevents free radical formation by quenching singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of oxygen. Vitamin C is another free radical scavenger which deactivates free radicals. It works specially in the plasma, lung fluid, aqueous humour and interstitial fluid. It can increase white blood cell activity; play important roles in the biochemistry of antibodies, prostaglandin E 1 , B and T lymphocytes, and interferon. Vitamin E also scavenges free radicals in the blood along with β carotene and vitamin C. Moreover, vitamin E is essential to protect against some of the ill effects of smog and smoke. In relation to other nutrients vitamin E protects vitamin A from being destroyed in the body.

Pharmacology






Beta carotene
 of this tablet is converted to vitamin A (Retinol) when required. Retinol has several biochemical functions e.g. on retina, growth, tissue differentiation, immunological response. It has also some anti-cancer activity.
Vitamin C
 is the most powerful reducing agent known to be present in living tissues. Vitamin C deficiency produces scurvy. It is a cofactor in numerous biological processes. Vitamin C and molecular oxygen are essential for the conversion of proline to hydroxyproline, dopamine to noradrenaline . Vitamin C is also essential for the synthesis of adrenal steroid hormones. Vitamin C is important in the defense against infection and studies shown that vitamin C is important for the normal functioning of T-lymphocyte and leukocyte. Ascorbic acid has some antiinflammatory activity and protects cells against oxidation of essential molecules. In high doses, (1-2 g daily) ascorbic acid increases iron absorption.
vitamin E
 seems to be as a defense against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In most cell membranes there is one molecule of tocopherol for every 1000 lipid molecules. Tocopherol mops up peroxide radicals and then needs a supply of reduced hydrogen to restore the steady-state situation. This is usually supplied by ascorbic acid or reduced glutathione.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            This tablet is administered orally. The adult dose of this combination of antioxidant vitamin tablet is 1 tablet daily or as prescribed by the physician.

Interaction





                            Cholestyramine, Colestipol, Neomycin cause decreased absorption of β carotene. Circulating vitamin C levels have been shown to be reduced during prolonged administration of oral contraceptives containing Oestrogen, Tetracycline and Aspirin. The decrease in vitamin C level may be due to drug induced impaired absorption or increased utilization of the vitamin for drug metabolism. Vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of anticoagulant drugs. High doses of vitamin E can impair intestinal absorption of vitamins A and K.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Carocet is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components.
                    










Side Effects






β carotene
 is comparatively safe even at high and prolonged exposure. Individuals who routinely ingest large amounts of carotenoids can develop hypercarotenosis, which is characterised by a yellowish colouration of the skin and a very high concentration of carotenoids in the plasma. This benign condition, although resembling jaundice, gradually disappears upon correcting the excessive intake of carotenoids.
Vitamin C
 is generally a safe drug for human use in normal doses. Larger doses may lead to gastrointestinal tract upset and renal stone formation.
Vitamin E
 is considered safe even in large doses. Doses over 800 mg may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain or cramps, fatigue and reduced resistance to bacterial infection and transiently raised blood pressure.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            β carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E have no teratogenic effects in humans. However, like any other drugs caution should be taken in prescribing to pregnant women.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            There are some evidences that β carotene may cause harm to heavy smokers and alcoholics. Therefore, caution should be exercised in these cases. Vitamin C should be given with caution to patients with hyperoxaluria. Vitamin E should be used with caution in patients taking anticoagulant drugs, because vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of these drugs.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Anti-oxidant Multivitamin preparations
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Should be stored in a dry place below 30˚C.

Pharmacology





                            Sodium Picosulfate is a triarylmethane group derivative stimulant laxative. After oral administration it is activated by the colonic bacteria and acts locally in the colon. The active form then stimulates the nerve endings of the intestinal wall and results in colonic peristalsis with promotion of accumulation of water and electrolytes in the colonic lumen. This results in stimulation of defecation, reduction of transit time and softening of the stool. Stimulation of the rectum causes increased motility and a feeling of rectal fullness. The rectal effect may help to restore the ""call to stool"".
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            For oral administration. The following dosages are recommended to be taken at night to produce evacuation the following morning. It is recommended to start with the lowest dose. The dose may be adjusted up to the maximum recommended dose to produce regular stools. The maximum recommended daily dose should not be exceeded:
10 mg tablet dose
:




Adults and children over 10 years of age: 5-10 mg per day.


Children aged 4-10 years: 2.5-5 mg per day.




Oral Solution (5 mg/5 ml) dose
:




Adults and children over 10 years of age: 5-10 ml or one to two teaspoonful per day.


Children aged 4-10 years: 2.5-5 ml or half to one teaspoonful per day.


Children from One month to 4 years of age: 0.25 ml/kg body weight per day.




Concentrated Oral Solution (7.5 mg/ml) dose
:




Adults and children over 10 years of age: 0.67-1.33 ml per day.


Children aged 4-10 years: 0.33-0.67 ml per day.

Interaction





                            The concomitant use of diuretics or adreno-corticosteroids may increase the risk of electrolyte imbalance if excessive doses are taken. Concurrent administration of antibiotics may reduce the laxative action of Abdolax.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Ileus or intestinal obstruction, severe painful and/or feverish acute abdominal conditions (e.g. appendicitis) potentially associated with nausea and vomiting, acute inflammatory bowel diseases, severe dehydration, known hypersensitivity to Sodium Picosulfate or any other component of the product.
                    










Side Effects





                            Hypersensitivity, dizziness, syncope, vasovagal response, gastrointestinal disorders, diarrhea, abdominal pain and abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation

Use of the drug should be avoided during the first trimester. Clinical data show that neither the active moiety of sodium Picosulfate (BHPM or bis-(p hydroxyphenyl)-pyridyl-2-methane) nor its glucuronides are excreted into the milk of healthy lactating females.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Prolonged excessive use may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalance and hypokalemia. Harmful for those suffering from alcoholism. To be taken into account in pregnant or breast-feeding women, children and high-risk groups such as patients with liver disease or epilepsy.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Laxatives when taken in chronic overdosage may cause chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, hypokalemia, secondary hyperaldosteronism, and renal calculi. Renal tubular damage, metabolic alkalosis, and muscle weakness secondary to hypokalemia have also been described in association with chronic laxative abuse.

Pharmacology





                            Dicycloverine hydrochloride is an antispasmodic and anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agent. Chemically, it is [Bicyclohexyl-]1-carboxylic acid, 2-(diethylammo) ethyl ester, hydrochloride. Dicycloverine relieves smooth muscle spasm of the gastrointestinal tract. Dicycloverine HCl Injection is a sterile, pyrogen-free, aqueous solution for intramuscular injection (Not For Intravenous Use). It works at specific receptors, called cholinergic (or muscarinic) receptors, located on the involuntary muscle in the walls of the gut. By binding to these receptors dicycloverine prevents certain chemicals produced by the body from interacting with these receptors. This causes the gut muscle to relax, relieving the pain of colic produced by gut muscle contraction and spasm.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            For oral dosage forms:




Adults
:10 to 20 mg three times a day.


Children over 6 months of age
: 5 to 10 mg three times a day.



For injectable dosage form: 




Adults
: Intramuscular injection. Not for intravenous use. The recommended intramuscular dose is 80 mg daily (in 4 equally divided doses).



Oral dicycloverine Hydrochloride should be started as soon as possible and the intramuscular form should not be used for periods longer than 1 or 2 days. 
Children
: Dose must be determined by the doctor.

Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy Category B. Dicycloverine was neither teratogenic nor embryocidal in animal trial. It, like other drugs should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. There are no data on the secretion of this drug into breast milk. Dicycloverine should be used cautiously in case of lactating mother.

Indications





                            Abecab is indicated for the treatment of hypertension alone or with other antihypertensive agents, to lower blood pressure. This is indicated as initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve their blood pressure goals. The decision to use a combination as initial therapy should be individualized and shaped by considerations such as baseline blood pressure, the target goal, and the incremental likelihood of achieving goal with a combination compared to monotherapy. Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient’s risk.

Pharmacology





                            Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amlodipine has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.
Angiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the Renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. 
Olmesartan Medoxomil blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that Olmesartan Medoxomil is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Olmesartan Medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin).
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            Substitute individually titrated components for patients on Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil. This combination may also be given with increased amounts of Amlodipine, Olmesartan Medoxomil, or both, as needed.
Initial therapy
: Initiate with 5/20 mg once daily for 1 to 2 weeks and titrate as needed up to a maximum of 10/40 mg once daily. Due to decreased clearance of Amlodipine among elderly patients the recommended starting dose of Amlodipine is 2.5 mg in patients 75 years. The lowest dose of the combination is 5/20 mg; therefore, initial therapy with this combination drug is not recommended in patients >75 years old.

Interaction





                            The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesartan Medoxomil may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes should be closely monitored in patients on combination therapy and other agents that affect the RAS.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Cannot be co-administered with Aliskiren in patients with diabetes.
                    










Side Effects





                            The most common side effects include peripheral edema, headache, flushing, and dizziness. It can also cause Intestinal problems known a sprue-like enteropathy.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy Category D. Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil combination should not be used in 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 trimester because it can cause fetal death. When pregnancy is detected this combination should be discontinued as soon as possible. It is not known whether Olmesartan and Amlodipine are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil combination should be used with caution because there is a risk for-




Hypotension in volume- or salt depleted patients.


Vasodilation in patients with severe aortic stenosis.


Increased frequency, duration or severity of angina or acute Ml in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease.

Indications





                            Abecab is indicated for the treatment of hypertension alone or with other antihypertensive agents, to lower blood pressure. This is indicated as initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve their blood pressure goals. The decision to use a combination as initial therapy should be individualized and shaped by considerations such as baseline blood pressure, the target goal, and the incremental likelihood of achieving goal with a combination compared to monotherapy. Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient’s risk.

Pharmacology





                            Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amlodipine has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.
Angiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the Renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. 
Olmesartan Medoxomil blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that Olmesartan Medoxomil is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Olmesartan Medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin).
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            Substitute individually titrated components for patients on Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil. This combination may also be given with increased amounts of Amlodipine, Olmesartan Medoxomil, or both, as needed.
Initial therapy
: Initiate with 5/20 mg once daily for 1 to 2 weeks and titrate as needed up to a maximum of 10/40 mg once daily. Due to decreased clearance of Amlodipine among elderly patients the recommended starting dose of Amlodipine is 2.5 mg in patients 75 years. The lowest dose of the combination is 5/20 mg; therefore, initial therapy with this combination drug is not recommended in patients >75 years old.

Interaction





                            The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesartan Medoxomil may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes should be closely monitored in patients on combination therapy and other agents that affect the RAS.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Cannot be co-administered with Aliskiren in patients with diabetes.
                    










Side Effects





                            The most common side effects include peripheral edema, headache, flushing, and dizziness. It can also cause Intestinal problems known a sprue-like enteropathy.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy Category D. Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil combination should not be used in 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 trimester because it can cause fetal death. When pregnancy is detected this combination should be discontinued as soon as possible. It is not known whether Olmesartan and Amlodipine are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil combination should be used with caution because there is a risk for-




Hypotension in volume- or salt depleted patients.


Vasodilation in patients with severe aortic stenosis.


Increased frequency, duration or severity of angina or acute Ml in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease.












Use in Special Populations






Pediatric use
: The safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years of age or older and younger subjects.
Renal impairment
: There are no studies in patients with renal impairment.
Hepatic impairment
: Initial therapy is not recommended in hepatically impaired patients.










Overdose Effects





                            There is no information on over dosage in humans.

Pharmacology





                            Abemaciclib is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6). These kinases are activated upon binding to D-cyclins. In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cell lines, cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 promote phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation. In vitro, continuous exposure to abemaciclib inhibited Rb phosphorylation and blocked progression from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle, resulting in senescence and apoptosis. In breast cancer xenograft models, abemaciclib dosed daily without interruption as a single agent or in combination with antiestrogens resulted in reduction of tumor size.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            Abemaciclib tablets are taken orally with or without food.




Recommended starting dose in combination with fulvestrant, tamoxifen, or an aromatase inhibitor: 150 mg twice daily.


Recommended starting dose as monotherapy: 200 mg twice daily.


Dosing interruption and/or dose reductions may be required based on individual safety and tolerability.

Interaction






CYP3A Inhibitors
: Avoid concomitant use of ketoconazole. Reduce the Abeclib dose with concomitant use of other strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors.
CYP3A Inducers
: Avoid concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inducers.
                    






















Side Effects





                            Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥20%) were diarrhea, neutropenia, nausea, abdominal pain, infections, fatigue, anemia, leukopenia, decreased appetite, vomiting, headache, alopecia, and thrombocytopenia.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, Abemaciclib can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of abemaciclib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and decreased fetal weight at maternal exposures that were similar to the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Abemaciclib and for 3 weeks after the last dose.
                    








Precautions & Warnings






Diarrhea
: Abeclib can cause severe cases of diarrhea, associated with dehydration and infection. Instruct patients at the first sign of loose stools to initiate antidiarrheal therapy, increase oral fluids, and notify their healthcare provider.
Neutropenia
: Monitor complete blood counts prior to the start of Abeclib therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated.
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis
: Severe and fatal cases of ILD/pneumonitis have been reported. Monitor for clinical symptoms or radiological changes indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue Abeclib in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 ILD or pneumonitis.
Hepatotoxicity
: Increases in serum transaminase levels have been observed. Perform liver function tests (LFTs) before initiating treatment with Abeclib. Monitor LFTs every two weeks for the first two months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated.
Venous Thromboembolism
: Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity
: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of potential
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of Abeclib have not been established in pediatric patients.
Geriatric Use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of Abeclib were observed between these patients and younger patients.
Renal Impairment
: No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.
Hepatic Impairment
: No dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment

Description





                            Aben-DS is a benzimidazole anthelmintic, active against most nematodes and some cestodes. It is used in the treatment of intestinal nematode infections and in higher doses in the treatment of hydatid disease. Aben-DS exhibits vermicidal, ovicidal, and larvicidal activity. The principal mode of action of Aben-DS is its inhibitory effect on tubulin polymerization, which results in the loss of cytoplasmic microtubules.
                    




















Pharmacology





                            Albendazole is a broad spectrum anthelmintic. Albendazole exhibits vermicidal, ovicidal and larvicidal activities. The drug is thought to exert its anthelmintic effect by blocking glucose uptake in the susceptible helminths, thereby depleting the energy level until it becomes inadequate for survival. Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adults & children over 2 years
: 




400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) as a single dose in cases of Enterobius vermicularis, Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides, Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus.


In cases of strongyloidiasis or taeniasis, 400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) daily should be given for 3 consecutive days. If the patient is not cured on follow-up after three weeks, a second course of treatment is indicated. 




Children of 1-2 years
: Recommended dose is a single dose of 200 mg (5 ml suspension).
Children under 1 year
: Not recommended.
In Hydatid disease (Echinococcosis)
: 




Albendazole is given by mouth with meals in a dose of 400 mg twice daily for 28 days for patients weighing over 60 kg.


A dose of 15 mg/kg body weight daily in two divided doses (to a maximum total daily dose of 800 mg) is used for patients weighing less than 60 kg.


For cystic echinococcosis, the 28 days course may be repeated after 14 days without treatment, to a total of 3 treatment cycles.


For alveolar echinococcosis, cycles of 28 days of treatment followed by 14 days without treatment, may need to continue for months or years.


In giardiasis, 400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) once daily for five days is used.

Interaction





                            No interaction involving Aben-DS, either pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic, has been reported.
                    




















Contraindications






Neonates
: Albendazole is not normally used in neonates.
Children
: Reduction of the dose from 400 mg to 200 mg may be indicated in children weighing less than 10 kg but there are no grounds for a general reduction in dosage to children.
Pregnant woman
: Albendazole should not be given during pregnancy or women thought to be pregnant. No information is available on placental transfer.
Concurrent disease
: There is no evidence to suggest that dose should be altered in renal, hepatic or cardiac failure.
                    










Side Effects





                            Gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, dizziness, changes in liver enzymes, rarely reversible alopecia; rash, fever, blood disorders including leucopenia and pancytopenia reported; allergic shock if cyst leakage; convulsion and meningism in cerebral disease.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            US FDA Pregnancy category of Albendazole is C. So, Albendazole should be avoided in pregnancy and lactation unless the potential benefits to the other outweigh the possible risks to the fetus.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Blood counts and liver function tests before treatment and twice during each cycle; breastfeeding; exclude pregnancy before starting treatment. Aben-DS should only be used in the treatment of Echinococcosis if there is constant medical supervision with regular monitoring of serum-transaminase concentrations and of leucocyte and platelet counts
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Anthelmintic
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Keep in a dry place, away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.

Pharmacology





                            Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            Dosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily. 
No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.
Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.

Interaction





                            No significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Abetis was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Abetis is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Abetis, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Abetis and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Abetis may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Olmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.
                    










Side Effects





                            Abetis has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Abetis was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Abetis and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Abetis and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Abetis and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)
The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Abetis, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Abetis (0.9%) patients.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            When pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Abetis. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Abetis.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            There is no experience of overdose with Abetis. The most likely effects of Abetis overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Abetis requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.

                            Abetis has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Abetis was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Abetis and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Abetis and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Abetis and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)
The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Abetis, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Abetis (0.9%) patients.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            When pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Abetis. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Abetis.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            There is no experience of overdose with Abetis. The most likely effects of Abetis overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Abetis requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.

Pharmacology





                            Angiotensin-II formed from angiotensin-I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin-II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In-vitro-binding studies indicate that Olmesartan is a reversible & competitive inhibitor of AT 1 receptor. Olmesartan does not inhibit ACE (kinase-I, the enzyme that converts angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II and degrades bradykinin).
Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing the excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases Aldosterone secretion & urinary Potassium loss and decreases serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin-II. So, co-administration of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Hypertension
: The usual starting dose is 20/12.5 mg one tablet once daily. Dosing should be individualized. Depending on the blood pressure response, the dose may be titrated at intervals of 2-4 weeks to two tablets 40/25 once daily.

Interaction






Olmesartan
: No significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Olmesartan Medoxomil was co-administered with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. Olmesartan Medoxomil is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected.
Hydrochlorothiazide
: When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with Thiazide diuretics:




Alcohol, Barbiturates or Narcotics: Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.


Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and Insulin): Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.


Other antihypertensive drugs: Additive effect.


Corticosteroids, ACTH.


Lithium.
























Contraindications





                            The combination of Olmesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Because of the Hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.
                    










Side Effects





                            The common side-effects are nausea, headache, dizziness, hyperuricemia, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection. Other adverse effects are chest pain, back pain, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, gastroenteritis, diarrhea.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Safety and effectiveness in nursing mother & pregnancy have not been established. The drug should be discontinued during these conditions.
                    








Precautions & Warnings








Periodic determination of serum electrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals to detect possible electrolyte imbalance like hypokalemia, hyponatremia and hypochloremic alkalosis.


Hyperuricemia may occur in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.


Impaired renal function.












Use in Special Populations






Renal Impairment Patients
: The usual regimens of therapy with this may be followed provided the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 ml/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. So, Abetis Plus is not recommended.
Hepatic Impairment Patients
: No dosage adjustment is necessary with hepatic impairment.
Paediatric use
: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.
Geriatric use
: Clinical studies of Olmesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide combination did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious.
                    








Overdose Effects






Olmesartan
: Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia. Supportive treatment should be instituted.
Hydrochlorothiazide
: The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and dehydration) resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias.

Indications





                            This is indicated for the symptomatic relief of upper respiratory tract disorders accompanied by productive cough which benefits from the administration of a nasal decongestant, a histamine H1 receptor antagonist and an expectorant combination.

Pharmacology






Pseudoephedrine
 is a decongestant as well as a bronchodilator for the upper respiratory tract, which gives symptomatic relief of nasal congestion. Pseudoephedrine is both an α-and β-adrenergic receptor agonist. It causes vasoconstriction via direct stimulation of α-adrenergic receptors of the respiratory mucosa. It also directly stimulates β-adrenergic receptors causing bronchial relaxation, increased heart rate and contractility.
Like ephedrine, pseudoephedrine releasing norepinephrine from its storage sites, an indirect effect. This is its main and direct mechanism of action. The displaced noradrenaline is released into the neuronal synapse where it is free to activate the postsynaptic adrenergic receptors.
Guaifenesin
 reduces the viscosity of tenacious sputum and is used as an expectorant. It increases the hydration of respiratory tract, thereby increasing the volume and reducing the viscosity of bronchial secretions.
Triprolidine
 is an antihistamine; it is used for the symptomatic relief of hypersensitivity reactions including rhinitis, conjunctivitis and urticaria.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adult and Children over 12 years
: 10 ml (2 teaspoonful) three times a day.
Children 6-12 years
: 5 ml (1 teaspoonful) three times a day.
Children 2-5 years
: 2.5 ml (1/2 teaspoonful) three times a day.
A physician’s advice is preferred before administering this preparation to children aged less than 2 years.

Interaction





                            Concomitant use of Pseudoephedrine, guaiphenasine & triprolidine with sympathomimetic agents such as decongestants, tricyclic antidepressants, appetite suppressants and amphetamine-like psychostimulants or with monoamine oxidase inhibitors which interfere with the catabolism of sympathomimetic amines may occasionally cause a rise in blood pressure. Because of its pseudoephedrine content, Pseudoephedrine, guaiphenasine & triprolidine partially reverse the hypotensive action of drugs which interfere with sympathetic activity including guanethidine, methyldopa, alpha-adrenergic blocking agents.

                            This is contraindicated in the cases of known hypersensitivity to any of its constituents, cardiovascular disease including hypertension, lower respiratory symptoms including asthma, monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) therapy.
                    










Side Effects





                            CNS depression or excitation, drowsiness (reported most frequently), sleep disturbances, hallucinations (rarely reported), skin rashes with or without irritation, tachycardia, dryness of mouth, nose and throat have occasionally been reported.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Although pseudoephedrine, triprolidine and guaiphenesin have been in widespread use of many years without apparent ill consequence, there are no specific data on their use during pregnancy. Caution should therefore be exercised by balancing the potential benefits of treatment of the mother against any possible hazards to the developing fetus.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            As with any other antihistamine therapy, Pseudoephedrine, guaiphenasine & triprolidine may cause drowsiness. If affected, patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery. Concomitant administration of alcohol or other centrally acting sedatives should be avoided. Although Pseudoephedrine has no pressor effects in normotensive patients but Pseudoephedrine, guaiphenasine & triprolidine should be used with caution to patients suffering from mild to moderate hypertension. Moreover, caution should also be exercised in the following disease conditions - hypertension and heart disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, elevated intra-ocular pressure, prostatic enlargement, severe renal and hepatic impairment. Abex should not be used for persistent or chronic cough, which occurs with smoking, asthma or emphysema or where excessive secretions accompany cough, unless directed by a physician.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            The effects of acute toxicity from Pseudoephedrine, guaiphenasine & triprolidine may include drowsiness, irritability, restlessness, lethargy, dizziness, gastrointestinal discomfort, respiratory depression, convulsion, tremor, tachycardia and hypertension. Incase of overdose, necessary measures should be taken to maintain and support respiration and control convulsion. Gastric lavage may be undertaken if indicated. Catheterization of bladder may be necessary.

Pharmacology





                            Abemaciclib is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6). These kinases are activated upon binding to D-cyclins. In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cell lines, cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 promote phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation. In vitro, continuous exposure to abemaciclib inhibited Rb phosphorylation and blocked progression from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle, resulting in senescence and apoptosis. In breast cancer xenograft models, abemaciclib dosed daily without interruption as a single agent or in combination with antiestrogens resulted in reduction of tumor size.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            Abemaciclib tablets are taken orally with or without food.




Recommended starting dose in combination with fulvestrant, tamoxifen, or an aromatase inhibitor: 150 mg twice daily.


Recommended starting dose as monotherapy: 200 mg twice daily.


Dosing interruption and/or dose reductions may be required based on individual safety and tolerability.

Interaction






CYP3A Inhibitors
: Avoid concomitant use of ketoconazole. Reduce the Abezino dose with concomitant use of other strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors.
CYP3A Inducers
: Avoid concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inducers.
                    






















Side Effects





                            Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥20%) were diarrhea, neutropenia, nausea, abdominal pain, infections, fatigue, anemia, leukopenia, decreased appetite, vomiting, headache, alopecia, and thrombocytopenia.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, Abemaciclib can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of abemaciclib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and decreased fetal weight at maternal exposures that were similar to the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Abemaciclib and for 3 weeks after the last dose.
                    








Precautions & Warnings






Diarrhea
: Abezino can cause severe cases of diarrhea, associated with dehydration and infection. Instruct patients at the first sign of loose stools to initiate antidiarrheal therapy, increase oral fluids, and notify their healthcare provider.

Pharmacology





                            Abemaciclib is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6). These kinases are activated upon binding to D-cyclins. In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cell lines, cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 promote phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation. In vitro, continuous exposure to abemaciclib inhibited Rb phosphorylation and blocked progression from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle, resulting in senescence and apoptosis. In breast cancer xenograft models, abemaciclib dosed daily without interruption as a single agent or in combination with antiestrogens resulted in reduction of tumor size.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            Abemaciclib tablets are taken orally with or without food.




Recommended starting dose in combination with fulvestrant, tamoxifen, or an aromatase inhibitor: 150 mg twice daily.


Recommended starting dose as monotherapy: 200 mg twice daily.


Dosing interruption and/or dose reductions may be required based on individual safety and tolerability.

Interaction






CYP3A Inhibitors
: Avoid concomitant use of ketoconazole. Reduce the Abezino dose with concomitant use of other strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors.
CYP3A Inducers
: Avoid concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inducers.
                    






















Side Effects





                            Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥20%) were diarrhea, neutropenia, nausea, abdominal pain, infections, fatigue, anemia, leukopenia, decreased appetite, vomiting, headache, alopecia, and thrombocytopenia.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, Abemaciclib can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of abemaciclib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and decreased fetal weight at maternal exposures that were similar to the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Abemaciclib and for 3 weeks after the last dose.
                    








Precautions & Warnings






Diarrhea
: Abezino can cause severe cases of diarrhea, associated with dehydration and infection. Instruct patients at the first sign of loose stools to initiate antidiarrheal therapy, increase oral fluids, and notify their healthcare provider.
Neutropenia
: Monitor complete blood counts prior to the start of Abezino therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated.
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis
: Severe and fatal cases of ILD/pneumonitis have been reported. Monitor for clinical symptoms or radiological changes indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue Abezino in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 ILD or pneumonitis.
Hepatotoxicity
: Increases in serum transaminase levels have been observed. Perform liver function tests (LFTs) before initiating treatment with Abezino. Monitor LFTs every two weeks for the first two months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated.
Venous Thromboembolism
: Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity
: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of potential
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of Abezino have not been established in pediatric patients.
Geriatric Use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of Abezino were observed between these patients and younger patients.
Renal Impairment
: No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.
Hepatic Impairment
: No dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment

Pharmacology





                            This is the combination of Sodium Alginate and Potassium Bicarbonate. Sodium Alginate is a naturally occurring substance. It reacts with the acid in the stomach to form a gel. Potassium Bicarbonate also reacts with the acid in the stomach to form bubbles of carbon dioxide. These bubbles are trapped by the gel formed by Sodium Alginate and they allow the gel to float like a raft on top of the stomach contents. The raft prevents acid in the stomach from flowing back into the esophagus. This relieves the symptoms of reflux such as heartburn. The mode of action of this is physical and does not depend on absorption into the systemic circulation. The raft lasts for up to 4 hours on top of the stomach contents and is then broken down in the digestive system and excreted in the feces.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            Tablet:




Adults and children over 12 years
: 1-2 tablets 3-4 times daily, after meals and before bedtime.


Children 6-12 years
: ½-1 tablet 3-4 times daily, after meals and before bedtime.



Suspension:




Adults and children 12 years and above
: 5-10 ml (1-2 teaspoonfuls) 3-4 times daily, after meals and before bedtime.


Children 2-12 years
: 2.5-5ml (½-1 teaspoonful) 3-4 times daily, after meals and before bedtime.




Use in children
: This is not recommended under 2 years of age.
Elderly
: No dose modifications are necessary for this age group.
Hepatic Impairment
: No dose modifications are necessary.
Renal Insufficiency
: Caution if a highly restricted salt diet is necessary.

Pharmacology





                            This is the combination of two antacids (Calcium carbonate and Sodium bicarbonate) and an alginate (Sodium alginate). The suspension work in two ways-




Neutralizing excess stomach acid to relieve the pain & discomfort


Forming a protective barrier over the stomach contents to soothe the burning pain in your chest.



The mode of action of the product is physical and does not depend on absorption into the systemic circulation. The product is a combination of two antacids (Calcium Carbonate and Sodium Bicarbonate) and an Alginate. On ingestion, the medicinal product reacts rapidly with gastric acid to form a raft of Alginic Acid gel having a near neutral pH and studies have shown that the raft interacts with and caps the acid pocket in the stomach, reducing esophageal acid exposure. The raft floats on the stomach contents effectively impeding gastro-esophageal reflux, for up to 4 hours, and protecting the esophagus from Acid, Pepsin and Bile.In severe cases the raft itself may be refluxed into the esophagus, in preference to the stomach contents, and exert a demulcent effect. In addition in vitro evidence has shown that the raft has a secondary action and is able to entrap bile and pepsin within it structure, further protecting the esophagus from these gastric components. Calcium Carbonate neutralizes gastric acid to provide fast relief from indigestion and heartburn.This effect is increased by the addition of Sodium Bicarbonate which also has a neutralizing action.

Pharmacology





                            This is the combination of two antacids (Calcium carbonate and Sodium bicarbonate) and an alginate (Sodium alginate). The suspension work in two ways-




Neutralizing excess stomach acid to relieve the pain & discomfort


Forming a protective barrier over the stomach contents to soothe the burning pain in your chest.



The mode of action of the product is physical and does not depend on absorption into the systemic circulation. The product is a combination of two antacids (Calcium Carbonate and Sodium Bicarbonate) and an Alginate. On ingestion, the medicinal product reacts rapidly with gastric acid to form a raft of Alginic Acid gel having a near neutral pH and studies have shown that the raft interacts with and caps the acid pocket in the stomach, reducing esophageal acid exposure. The raft floats on the stomach contents effectively impeding gastro-esophageal reflux, for up to 4 hours, and protecting the esophagus from Acid, Pepsin and Bile.In severe cases the raft itself may be refluxed into the esophagus, in preference to the stomach contents, and exert a demulcent effect. In addition in vitro evidence has shown that the raft has a secondary action and is able to entrap bile and pepsin within it structure, further protecting the esophagus from these gastric components. Calcium Carbonate neutralizes gastric acid to provide fast relief from indigestion and heartburn.This effect is increased by the addition of Sodium Bicarbonate which also has a neutralizing action.

Indications





                            Abiret is a CYP17 inhibitor indicated in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with




Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).


Metastatic high-risk castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC).

Pharmacology





                            Abiraterone Acetate is converted in vivo to Abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, that inhibits 17 α-hydroxylase/C17, 20-lyase (CYP17). This enzyme is expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis. CYP17 catalyzes two sequential reactions:
1. The conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17 α-hydroxy derivatives by 17 α-hydroxylase activity and 
2. The subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, by C17, 20 lyase activity. DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and are precursors of testosterone. Inhibition of CYP17 by Abiraterone can also result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals. Androgen sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy, decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumor.
Abiraterone Acetate decreased serum testosterone and other androgens in patients in the placebo-controlled clinical trial. It is not necessary to monitor the effect of Abiraterone Acetate on serum testosterone levels. Changes in serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels may be observed but have not been shown to correlate with clinical benefit in individual patients.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Recommended Dose For Metastatic CRPC
: The recommended dose of Abiraterone Acetate is 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or four 250 mg tablets) orally once daily with Prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily. 
Recommended Dose For Metastatic High-Risk CSPC
: The recommended dose of Abiraterone Acetate is 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or four 250 mg tablets) orally once daily with Prednisone 5 mg administered orally once daily. 
Patients receiving Abiraterone Acetate should also receive a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or should have had bilateral orchiectomy. Abiraterone Acetate must be taken on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or at least two hours atier a meal. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water. Do not crush or chew tablets.
Dose Modification
:




For patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), reduce the Abiraterone Acetate starting dose to 250 mg once daily.


For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment, hold Abiraterone Acetate until recovery. Retreatment may be initated at a reduced dose. Abiraterone Acetate should be discontinued if patients develop severe hepatotoxicity.


Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Rifampin, Rifabutin, Rifapentine, Phenobarbital) during Abiraterone Acetate treatment. If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the Abiraterone Acetate dosing frequency to twice a day only during the co-administration period (e.g., from 1,000 mg once daily to 1,000 mg twice a day). Reduce the dose back to the previous dose and frequency, if the concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued. Or, as directed by the registered physician.




Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

Interaction






Drugs That Inhibit Or Induce CYP3A4 Enzymes
: Based on in vitro data, Abiret is a substrate of CYP3A4. In a dedicated drug interaction trial, co-administration of Rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, decreased exposure of Abiret by 55%. Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers during Abiret treatment. If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the Abiret dosing frequency. In a dedicated drug interaction trial, co-administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of Abiret.
Effects Of Abiret On Drug Metabolizing Enzymes
: Abiret is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C8. In a CYP2D6 drug-drug interaction trial, the Cmax and AUC of Dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) were increased 2.8- and 2.9-fold, respectively, when Dextromethorphan was given with Abiret 1,000 mg daily and Prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Avoid co-administration of Abiret with substrates of CYP2D6 with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., Thioridazine). If alternative treatments cannot be used, consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate drug. In a CYP2C8 drug-drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, the AUC of Pioglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate) was increased by 46% when Pioglitazone was given together with a single dose of 1,000 mg Abiret. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate with a narrow therapeutic index if used concomitantly with Abiret.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Hypersensitivity to the Abiraterone acetate or to any of the excipients of Abiraterone.
                    










Side Effects





                            The most common adverse reactions are fatigue, arthalgia, hypertension, nausea, edema, hypokalemia, hot flush, diarrhea, vomiting, upper respiratory infection, cough, and headache.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            The safety and efficacy of Abiraterone have not been established in females. Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, Abiraterone can cause fetal harm and potential loss of pregnancy. There are no human data on the use of Abiraterone in pregnant women. The safety and efficacy of Abiraterone have not been established in females. There is no information available on the presence of abiraterone acetate in human milk, or on the effects on the breastfed child or milk production.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Abiret may cause hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention as a consequence of increased mineralocorticoid levels resulting from CYP17 inhibition. Patients should be monitored for hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention at least once a month. Hypertension and hypokalemia should be controlled and corrected before and during treatment with Abiret. Patients should be monitored for symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency. Serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin levels should be measured prior to starting treatment with Abiret, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereatier.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            There is no specific antidote. In the event of an overdose, Abiret should be stopped, general supportive measures are undertaken, including monitoring for arrhythmias and cardiac failure and assess liver function.

Pharmacology





                            Abiraterone Acetate is converted in vivo to Abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, that inhibits 17 α-hydroxylase/C17, 20-lyase (CYP17). This enzyme is expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis. CYP17 catalyzes two sequential reactions:
1. The conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17 α-hydroxy derivatives by 17 α-hydroxylase activity and 
2. The subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, by C17, 20 lyase activity. DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and are precursors of testosterone. Inhibition of CYP17 by Abiraterone can also result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals. Androgen sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy, decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumor.
Abiraterone Acetate decreased serum testosterone and other androgens in patients in the placebo-controlled clinical trial. It is not necessary to monitor the effect of Abiraterone Acetate on serum testosterone levels. Changes in serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels may be observed but have not been shown to correlate with clinical benefit in individual patients.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Recommended Dose For Metastatic CRPC
: The recommended dose of Abiraterone Acetate is 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or four 250 mg tablets) orally once daily with Prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily. 
Recommended Dose For Metastatic High-Risk CSPC
: The recommended dose of Abiraterone Acetate is 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or four 250 mg tablets) orally once daily with Prednisone 5 mg administered orally once daily. 
Patients receiving Abiraterone Acetate should also receive a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or should have had bilateral orchiectomy. Abiraterone Acetate must be taken on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or at least two hours atier a meal. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water. Do not crush or chew tablets.
Dose Modification
:




For patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), reduce the Abiraterone Acetate starting dose to 250 mg once daily.


For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment, hold Abiraterone Acetate until recovery. Retreatment may be initated at a reduced dose. Abiraterone Acetate should be discontinued if patients develop severe hepatotoxicity.


Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Rifampin, Rifabutin, Rifapentine, Phenobarbital) during Abiraterone Acetate treatment. If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the Abiraterone Acetate dosing frequency to twice a day only during the co-administration period (e.g., from 1,000 mg once daily to 1,000 mg twice a day). Reduce the dose back to the previous dose and frequency, if the concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued. Or, as directed by the registered physician.




Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

Interaction






Drugs That Inhibit Or Induce CYP3A4 Enzymes
: Based on in vitro data, Abiron is a substrate of CYP3A4. In a dedicated drug interaction trial, co-administration of Rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, decreased exposure of Abiron by 55%. Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers during Abiron treatment. If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the Abiron dosing frequency. In a dedicated drug interaction trial, co-administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of Abiron.
Effects Of Abiron On Drug Metabolizing Enzymes
: Abiron is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C8. In a CYP2D6 drug-drug interaction trial, the Cmax and AUC of Dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) were increased 2.8- and 2.9-fold, respectively, when Dextromethorphan was given with Abiron 1,000 mg daily and Prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Avoid co-administration of Abiron with substrates of CYP2D6 with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., Thioridazine). If alternative treatments cannot be used, consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate drug. In a CYP2C8 drug-drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, the AUC of Pioglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate) was increased by 46% when Pioglitazone was given together with a single dose of 1,000 mg Abiron. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate with a narrow therapeutic index if used concomitantly with Abiron.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Hypersensitivity to the Abiraterone acetate or to any of the excipients of Abiraterone.
                    










Side Effects





                            The most common adverse reactions are fatigue, arthalgia, hypertension, nausea, edema, hypokalemia, hot flush, diarrhea, vomiting, upper respiratory infection, cough, and headache.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            The safety and efficacy of Abiraterone have not been established in females. Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, Abiraterone can cause fetal harm and potential loss of pregnancy. There are no human data on the use of Abiraterone in pregnant women. The safety and efficacy of Abiraterone have not been established in females. There is no information available on the presence of abiraterone acetate in human milk, or on the effects on the breastfed child or milk production.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Abiron may cause hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention as a consequence of increased mineralocorticoid levels resulting from CYP17 inhibition. Patients should be monitored for hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention at least once a month. Hypertension and hypokalemia should be controlled and corrected before and during treatment with Abiron. Patients should be monitored for symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency. Serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin levels should be measured prior to starting treatment with Abiron, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereatier.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            There is no specific antidote. In the event of an overdose, Abiron should be stopped, general supportive measures are undertaken, including monitoring for arrhythmias and cardiac failure and assess liver function.

Pharmacology





                            Persistent activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in Central Nervous System by the excitatory amino acid glutamate has been hypothesized to contribute to the symptomatology of Alzheimer's disease. Memantine is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect through its action as a low to moderate affinity as an uncompetitive (open-channel) NMDA receptor antagonist which binds preferentially to the NMDA receptor-operated cation channels.
Memantine is well absorbed after oral administration and has linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range. It is excreted predominantly unchanged in the urine and has a terminal elimination half-life of about 60-80 hours. Following oral administration, Memantine is highly absorbed with peak concentrtions reached in about 3-7 hours. Food has no effect on the absorption of Memantine. The mean volume of distribution of Memantine is 9-11 L/kg and the plasma protein binding is low (45%). emantine undergoes partial hepatic metabolism. About 48% of administered drug is excreted unchanged in urine; the remainder is converted primarily to three polar metabolites which possess minimal NMDA receptor antagonistic activity: the N-glucuronide conjugate, 6-hydroxy Memantine and 1-nitroso-deaminated Memantine. A total of 74% of the administered dose is excreted as the sum of the parent drug and the N-glucuronide conjugate. The hepatic microsomal CYP-450 enzyme system does not play a significant role in the metabolism of Memantine.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            The recommended maintenance dose of Memantine for adults and older patients is 20 mg every day. In order to lower the risk of side effects, the dose should be achieved by upward titration with 5 mg per week over 3 weeks, achieving the maintenance dose of 20 mg/day from the start of week 4 according to the following dosage guideline:
Week 1 (Everyday)
: Morning- 5 mg (1 tablet), Night- No dose
Week 2 (Everyday)
: Morning- 5 mg (1 tablet), Night- 5 mg (1 tablet)
Week 3 (Everyday)
: Morning- 10 mg (2 tablets), Night- 5 mg (1 tablet)
Week 4 and onwards (Everyday)
: Morning- 10 mg (2 tablets), Night- 10 mg (2 tablets)
Missed Dose
: If any dose is missed, just wait and take the next dose at the usual time. Do not double the dose to compensate for the missed dose.
In case renal impairment
: In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg (1 ml solution, equivalent to two downward strokes). If tolerated well after at least 7 days of treatment, the dose could be increased up to 20 mg/day according to standard titration scheme. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 5-29 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg (1 ml solution, equivalent to two downward strokes) per day.
In case of hepatic impairment
: In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impaired function, no dosage adjustment is needed. Administration of memantine is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
Children under 18 years
: Memantine is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to lack of data on safety and efficacy.

Interaction





                            Due to the pharmacological effects and mechanism of action of memantine suggests that the effects of L-dopa, dopaminergic agonists, and anticholinergics may be enhanced by concomitant treatment with NMDA-antagonists such as memantine. The effects of barbiturates and neuroleptics may be reduced. Concomitant administration of mematine with the antispasmodic agents, dantrolene or baclofen, can modify their effects and a dosage adjustment may be necessary. Abixa should not be used with amantadine, ketamine, dextromethorphan, phenytoin, cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinidine, quinine & nicotine.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Memantine Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Memantine Hydrochloride or to any excipients used in the formulation.
                    










Side Effects





                            Most frequent side effects (frequency of 2% or less) include hallucination, confusion, dizziness, headache and fatigue. Occasional side effects include anxiety, hypertonus (heightened muscle tension), vomiting, bladder infections and increased sexual drive. If there is a history of epileptic seizures, there is a slight chance that Abixa may increase the probability of an attack.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy Category B. Yet there are no adequate and well controlled studies of Memantine in pregnant women. Memantine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether Memantine is excreted in human breast milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Memantine is administered to a nursing mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Caregivers should be instructed in the recommended administration (twice per day for doses above 5 mg) and dose escalation (minimum interval of one week between dose increases). If the patients suffer from kidney dysfunction, the kidney function should be monitored at regular basis.
Seizures:
 Abixa has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. One clinical trial shows that seizures occurred in 0.2% of patients treated with Abixa and 0.5% of patients treated with placebo.
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility:
 Study shows that no risk of carcinogenesis, mutagenesis and impairment of fertility are caused after Abixa use.
Operating Vehicles or Machinery
: Taking Abixa may alter the reaction time significantly; therefore safe driving and safe operation of machinery may no longer be possible.

Composition






Each box
 
contains 2 blister strips
.




One strip contains 1 tablet of Mifepristone INN 200 mg
.


Another strip contains 4 tablets of Misoprostol USP 200 microgram each.




































Pharmacology





                            Mifepristone: Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid with anti-progestational activity results from competitive interaction with progesterone at progesterone-receptor sites. Based on studies with various oral doses in several animal species, the compound inhibits the activity of endogenous or exogenous progesterone and the Menstrual Regulation (MR) results. During pregnancy, the compound sensitizes the myometrium to the contraction-inducing activity of prostaglandins.
Misoprostol: Misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1. It causes myometrial contraction by interacting with specific receptors on myometrial cells. This interaction results in a change in calcium concentration, thereby initiating muscle contraction. By interacting with prostaglandin receptors, Misoprostol causes the cervix to soften and the uterus to contract, resulting in the expulsion of the uterine contents.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            This can only be prescribed by qualified medical professionals who are able to assess the gestational age of an embryo and to diagnose ectopic pregnancies. The qualified medical professionals must also be able to provide surgical Intervention/MVA (Manual Vaccum Aspiration) in cases of incomplete abortion or severe bleeding or have made plans to provide such care through others and be able to assure patient access to medical facilities equipped to provide blood transfusions and resuscitation, if necessary.
Day 1 (First visit)
: Mifepristone administration: One tablet of Mifepristone (200 mg) is taken in a single oral dose under the supervision of a qualified medical professional in a clinic, medical office or hospital.
Day 2 (Second visit)
: Misoprostol administration: 24-48 hours after ingesting the Mifepristone tablet, the patient takes four 200 microgram tablets (800 micrograms) of Misoprostol buccally or sublingually. Misoprostol tablets can be administered by the patient herself (place two tablets on each side of cheeck & gum or under the tongue). She should wait for 30 minutes. During the period immediately following the administration of Misoprostol, the patient may need medication for cramps or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient should be given instructions on what to do if significant discomfort, excessive bleeding or other adverse reactions occur and should be given a phone number to call if she has questions following the administration of Misoprostol. 
Day 10 to 14 (Third visit)
: Post-treatment examination: Patients must return to the clinic, medical office or hospital within 10 to 14 days after the administration of mifepristone. This visit is very important to confirm by clinical examination or ultrasonographic scan that a complete termination of pregnancy has occurred. 
Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at this visit have a risk of fetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/termination of pregnancy failures.

Interaction





                            Mifepristone: Although specific drug or food interactions with Mifepristone have not been studied, on the basis of ABO Kit's metabolism by CYP 3A4, it is possible that Ketoconazole, Itraconazole, Erythromycin and grapefruit juice may inhibit its metabolism (increasing serum levels of mifepristone).
Misoprostol: Misoprostol has not been shown to interfere with the beneficial effects of aspirin on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Misoprostol does not exert clinically significant effects on the absorption,blood levels and antiplatelet effects of therapeutic doses of aspirin.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Administration of Mifepristone is contraindicated in patients with any one of the following conditions: History of allergy or known hypersensitivity to Mifepristone, Misoprostol or other prostaglandin, confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy or undiagnosed adnexal mass (the treatment procedure will not be effective to terminate an ectopic pregnancy), IUD in place, chronic adrenal failure, haemorrhagic disorders or concurrent anticoagulant therapy, inherited porphyria, If a patient does not have adequate access to medical facilities equipped to provide emergency treatment of incomplete process, blood transfusions and emergency resuscitation during the period from the first visit until discharged by the administering physician.
                    










Side Effects





                            Mifepristone: The treatment procedure is designed to induce vaginal bleeding and uterine cramping necessary for Menstrual Regulation (MR). Commonly reported side effects were nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Pelvic pain, fainting, headache, dizziness, and asthenia occurred rarely.
Misoprostol: Gastro-intestinal side-effects like diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, dyspepsia, headache, vomiting and constipation, shivering, hyperthermia, dizziness, pain due to uterine contractions, severe vaginal bleeding, shock, pelvic pain, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy and/or salpingo-oophorectomy).
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy- 
Mifepristone
: is indicated for Menstrual Regulation (MR) (through 63 days pregnancy) and has no other approved indication for use during pregnancy. Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at the last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR) treatment failures.
Lactation- 




Mifepristone
: It is not known whether Mifepristone is excreted through human milk. Many hormones with a similar chemical structure, however, are excreted in breast milk. Since the effects of Mifepristone on infants are unknown, breast-feeding women should consult with their doctor to decide if they should discard their breast milk for a few days following administration of the medications.


Misoprostol
: Although it is not known whether Misoprostol or Misoprostol is excreted through human milk, Misoprostol should not be administered to nursing mothers because the potential excretion of misoprostol acid could cause diarrhoea in nursing infants.












Precautions & Warnings





                            The patient should not give combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol to anyone else. The combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, it may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she is or were to become pregnant. Any Intra Uterine Device [IUD] should be removed before treatment with Mifepristone begins. Menstrual Regulation (MR) by surgery is recommended in cases when combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol fails to cause Menstrual Regulation (MR). Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/ termination of pregnancy failures.
                    








Use in Special Populations





                            Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic disease should receive a decreased dose of Misoprostol.
Use in Patients with Renal Impairment: No routine dosage adjustment is recommended of Misoprostol in older patients or patients with renal impairment but the dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Mifepristone: No serious adverse reactions were reported in tolerance studies in healthy nonpregnant female and healthy male subjects where Mifepristone was administered in single doses greater than threefold of 600mg for Menstrual Regulation (MR). If a patient ingests a massive overdose, she should be observed closely for signs of adrenal failure.
Misoprostol: Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are a sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fever, palpitations, hypotension or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. However, because Misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be the appropriate treatment for overdosage.

Pharmacology





                            Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. Maximum plasma concentrations of Misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of Misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 meg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of Misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Benign gastric and duodenal ulceration and NSAID associated ulceration
: 800 mcg daily (in 2-4 divided doses) with breakfast or main meals and at bedtime; treatment should be continued for at least 4 weeks and may be continued for up to 8 weeks if required.
Prophylaxis of NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcer
: 200 mcg 2-4 times daily taken with NSAID. If this dose cannot be tolerated, a dose of 100 mcg can be used. Misoprostol should be taken for the duration of NSAID therapy as prescribed by the physician.
Induction of labor
: Place 25 mcg in the posterior fornix of the vagina. Repeat after every 6 hours if necessary until the maximum dosage of 200 mcg total misoprostol is reached. Fetal heart rate and uterus contractions should be monitored. Alternatively, 100 mcg taken orally. If cervical ripening or active labor does not occur, repeated dose of 100-200 mcg of oral misoprostol is given every 4 hourly until labor is established (as evidenced by a Bishop score of 7 or more). Maximum number of dose is 6. Maternal vital signs, fetal heart rate and contractions should be monitored. Oxytocin can be started 4 hours after last dose of misoprostol. Physician should be notified for signs of fetal distress or tetanic uterine contractions. Oral misoprostol therapy should be monitored by Physician.
Prevention of postpartum hemorrhage
: 600 mcg orally immediately following delivery.
Treatment of postpartum hemorrhage
: 600 mcg orally or 1000 mcg per rectally.

Interaction





                            There is no evidence of clinically significant interaction between Aboprost and cardiac, pulmonary, CNS drugs and NSAID's. The bioavailability of Aboprost is decreased with high doses of antacid.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Misoprostol is contraindicated to anyone with a history of allergy to prostaglandins and it is also contraindicated in pregnancy.
                    










Side Effects





                            Generally, Aboprost is well tolerated. The most frequent adverse effects associated with Aboprost therapy involve the GI tract such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, rashes and dizziness. The incidence of diarrhea may be minimized by administering the drug after meal and at bedtime and by avoiding concomitant administration with a magnesium-containing or other laxative antacid.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Because of the abortifacient property of the Misoprostol component, it is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. It should not be used in women of childbearing potential unless the patient requires nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy and is at high risk of developing gastric or duodenal ulceration or for developing complications from gastric or duodenal ulcers associated with the use of the NSAID. In such patients, it may be prescribed if the patient:




has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning therapy.


is capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures.


has received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of Misoprostol, the risk of possible contraception failure, and the danger to other women of childbearing potential should the drug be taken by mistake.


will begin it only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period.



Excretion of the active metabolite (Misoprostol acid) into milk is possible but has not been studied. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, it is not recommended for use by nursing mothers.
                    








Precautions & Warnings






In case of prevention and treatment of NSAID induced gastric and duodenal ulcer
: Aboprost is contraindicated in women who are pregnant, and should not be used in women of child bearing potential unless the patient requires NSAID therapy. Women of child bearing potential should be told that they must not be pregnant when Aboprost therapy is initiated and they must use an effective contraception method while taking Aboprost.
In case of induction of labor
: The pregnancy should have completed 38 weeks gestation by reliable dating, or lung maturity as evidenced by a L/S >2.0 or a positive phosphotidyl glycerol test, or completed 36 weeks gestation with a maternal or fetal medical indication for induction of labor. Induction of labor is contraindicated in acute fetal distress, abruptio placenta, placenta previa or unexplained vaginal bleeding. The fetus should be in vertex presentation.
                    








Use in Special Populations





                            Use in children: Safety and effectiveness of Aboprost in children below the age of 18 years have not been established.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            The toxic dose of Aboprost in human has not been determined. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are a sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea and fever. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Drugs acting on the Uterus, Prostaglandin analogues

Indications





                            This eye drop is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

'














































Pharmacology





                            This eye drops is comprised of two components: Brimonidine Tartrate & Timolol Maleate. Brimonidine Tartrate is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist having a dual mechanism of action. It decreases aqueous humor production and increases nonpressure dependent uveoscleral outflow. Timolol Maleate is a β-adrenergic receptor antagonist that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. It lowers IOP by reducing aqueous humor production. Therefore the combination of both drugs gives a rapid onset of action, with peak ocular hypotensive effect seen within two hours of administration.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            Instill 1 drop in the affected eye(s) twice daily.

Interaction





                            Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any component of this product. Also contraindicated in bronchial asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sinus bradycardia, second or third-degree atrioventricular block, overt cardiac failure and cardiogenic shock.
                    










Side Effects





                            The most common side effects are allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival folliculosis, conjunctival hyperaemia, eye pruritus and ocular burning or stinging.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Combipres should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Timolol has been detected in human milk but it is not known whether Brimonidine Tartrate is excreted in human milk. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Like other topically applied ophthalmic agents, it may be absorbed systemically. Due to the presence of Timolol, the same types of cardiovascular and pulmonary adverse reactions as seen with systemic beta-blockers may occur. Cautions should be exercised in treating patients with severe or unstable and uncontrolled cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Use in children
: Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 2 years have not been established.
Use in elderly patients
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients.

Pharmacology





                            Salbutamol is a synthetic sympathomimetic agent with predominant beta-2 adrenergic activity. Salbutamol produces bronchodilatation through stimulation of beta-2-adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscles, thereby causing relaxation of bronchial muscle fibers. This action is manifested by an improvement in pulmonary function as demonstrated by spirometric measurements.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Salbutamol tablet or syrup-
Children:




2-6 years: 2.5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily


6-12 years: 5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily


Over 12 years: 5-10 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily (2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily)



Adults: 2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily. Maximum single dose is 8 mg tablet.
Salbutamol Respirator Solution
: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.
Method-1 (Intermittent Administration):




Adults (and the elderly): 0.5 ml-1.0 ml salbutamol up to four times a day. Up to 40mg per day can be given under strict medical direction in the hospital. 0.5-1 ml solution should be diluted to final volume of 2-4 ml with sterile normal saline solution. It will take time about 10 minutes.


Salbutamol respiratory solution may be used undiluted for intermittent administration. For this 2.0 ml of the solution is placed in the nebulizer and the patient allowed to inhale until bronchodilation is achieved. This usually takes 3-5 minutes.


Children under 12 years of age: 0.5 ml of the solution diluted to 2.0-4.0 ml with normal saline. Some children may however require higher doses of up to 1.0 ml of the solution. Intermittent treatment may be repeated four times a day.



Method-2 (Continuous administration): 1-2 ml solution is diluted to make up to 100 ml with normal saline solution. The diluted solution is administered by a suitable nebulizer devise. When there is risk of anoxia through hypoventilation, oxygen should be added to the inspired air.
Salbutamol nebulizer solution
: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.




Adults & Elderly: 2.5 mg to 5 mg Salbutamol up to 4 times a day. Up to 40 mg/day may be given under strict medical direction in the hospital.


Children under 12 years: 2.5 mg up to 4 times a day. A higher dose up to 5 mg four times a day may be used if required.




Salbutamol injection
:
Adults:




Salbutamol I.V. infusion solution is used to prepare a solution for continuous intravenous infusion. It should not be injected undiluted. A suitable solution for infusion may be prepared by diluting 5 mL of Salbutamol I.V. infusion solution (1000 mcg/mL) in 500 mL of a chosen i.v. solution to provide a salbutamol concentration of 10 mcg/mL.


The only recommended diluents are Sodium Chloride Injection, or Sodium Chloride and Dextrose Injection.


Infusion rates providing 3 to 20 micrograms salbutamol/minute (0.3 to 2ml/minute of the above infusion solution) are usually adequate. Infusion rates can be started at 5 mcg of salbutamol/min., and can be increased to 10 mcg/min., and 20 mcg/min. at 15 - 30 minute intervals, if necessary.


As with all parenteral drug products, intravenous admixtures should be inspected visually for clarity, particulate matter, precipitate, discoloration and leakage prior to administration.


All unused admixtures of Salbutamol infusion solution with infusion fluids should be discarded 24 hours after preparation.



Children and Adolescents (<18 years of age): The dosage of Salbutamol infusion solution in the pediatric age group has not been established. At present, there are insufficient data to recommend a dosage regimen for children.
Salbutamol Inhalation Capsule
:




Adults: For the relief of bronchospasm and for managing intermittent episodes of asthma, one or two inhalation capsule may be administered as a single dose. The usual recommended dosage of Salbutamol inhalation capsule for inhalation for adults for maintenance or prophylactic therapy is the contents of one 200 microgram capsule every 4 to 6 hours using a device. In some patients, the contents of two 200 microgram capsules inhaled every 4 to 6 hours may be required. Large doses or more frequent administration is not recommended. The use of salbutamol powder for inhalation can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring/intermittent episodes of bronchospasm.


Children: One Salbutamol inhalation capsule is the recommended dose for relief of acute bronchospasm in the maintenance of episodic asthma or before exercise of children 4 years of age and older. One inhalation should be administered for three or four times a day for routine maintenance or prophylactic therapy. This dosage may be increased to inhalation of two inhalation capsule, if necessary. The bronchodilator effect of each administration of inhaled Salbutamol inhalation capsule lasts for at least four hours. Such patients should be warned not to increase the dose of inhaler, but should seek medical advice immediately.



Excercise-induced Asthma: 




Adults: 400 microgram


Child: 200 microgram, 15-30 minutes prior to any physical exertion.

Side Effects





                            Absol may cause fine tremor of skeletal muscles (particularly the hands), palpitations and muscle cramps. Tachycardia, tenseness, headaches and peripheral vasodilatation have been reported after large doses.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            The drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential of tumorigenecity shown for Salbutamol in some animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Absol should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, occlusive vascular disorders, hypertension and aneurysms. Hypokalaemia associated with high doses of Absol may result in increased susceptibility to digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmia. Tachyphylaxis with resistance may occur with prolonged use of high dosage. Care is necessary when treating patients with diabetes mellitus or closed angle glaucoma, and in those receiving antihypertensive therapy.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            The symptoms with overdosage are angina, headache, nausea, vomiting, tremor etc. The preferred antidote for overdosage with Absol is a cardio-selective beta-blocking agent but beta-blocking drugs should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Short-acting selective & β2-adrenoceptor stimulants

Description





                            ABZ is a benzimidazole anthelmintic, active against most nematodes and some cestodes. It is used in the treatment of intestinal nematode infections and in higher doses in the treatment of hydatid disease. ABZ exhibits vermicidal, ovicidal, and larvicidal activity. The principal mode of action of ABZ is its inhibitory effect on tubulin polymerization, which results in the loss of cytoplasmic microtubules.
                    




















Pharmacology





                            Albendazole is a broad spectrum anthelmintic. Albendazole exhibits vermicidal, ovicidal and larvicidal activities. The drug is thought to exert its anthelmintic effect by blocking glucose uptake in the susceptible helminths, thereby depleting the energy level until it becomes inadequate for survival. Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adults & children over 2 years
: 




400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) as a single dose in cases of Enterobius vermicularis, Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides, Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus.


In cases of strongyloidiasis or taeniasis, 400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) daily should be given for 3 consecutive days. If the patient is not cured on follow-up after three weeks, a second course of treatment is indicated. 




Children of 1-2 years
: Recommended dose is a single dose of 200 mg (5 ml suspension).
Children under 1 year
: Not recommended.
In Hydatid disease (Echinococcosis)
: 




Albendazole is given by mouth with meals in a dose of 400 mg twice daily for 28 days for patients weighing over 60 kg.


A dose of 15 mg/kg body weight daily in two divided doses (to a maximum total daily dose of 800 mg) is used for patients weighing less than 60 kg.


For cystic echinococcosis, the 28 days course may be repeated after 14 days without treatment, to a total of 3 treatment cycles.


For alveolar echinococcosis, cycles of 28 days of treatment followed by 14 days without treatment, may need to continue for months or years.


In giardiasis, 400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) once daily for five days is used.

Interaction





                            No interaction involving ABZ, either pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic, has been reported.
                    




















Contraindications






Neonates
: Albendazole is not normally used in neonates.
Children
: Reduction of the dose from 400 mg to 200 mg may be indicated in children weighing less than 10 kg but there are no grounds for a general reduction in dosage to children.
Pregnant woman
: Albendazole should not be given during pregnancy or women thought to be pregnant. No information is available on placental transfer.
Concurrent disease
: There is no evidence to suggest that dose should be altered in renal, hepatic or cardiac failure.
                    










Side Effects





                            Gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, dizziness, changes in liver enzymes, rarely reversible alopecia; rash, fever, blood disorders including leucopenia and pancytopenia reported; allergic shock if cyst leakage; convulsion and meningism in cerebral disease.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            US FDA Pregnancy category of Albendazole is C. So, Albendazole should be avoided in pregnancy and lactation unless the potential benefits to the other outweigh the possible risks to the fetus.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Blood counts and liver function tests before treatment and twice during each cycle; breastfeeding; exclude pregnancy before starting treatment. ABZ should only be used in the treatment of Echinococcosis if there is constant medical supervision with regular monitoring of serum-transaminase concentrations and of leucocyte and platelet counts

Indications





                            Acaril is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Pharmacology





                            In contrast to sulfonylureas, Acarbose does not enhance insulin secretion. The antihyperglycemic action of acarbose results from a competitive, reversible inhibition of pancreatic alpha-amylase and membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucoside hydrolase enzymes. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine, while the membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the brush border of the small intestine. In diabetic patients, this enzyme inhibition results in a delayed glucose absorption and a lowering of postprandial hyperglycemia. Because its mechanism of action is different, the effect of Acarbose to enhance glycemic control is additive to that of sulfonylureas, insulin or metformin when used in combination. In addition, Acarbose diminishes the insulinotropic and weight-increasing effects of sulfonylureas. Acarbose has no inhibitory activity against lactase and consequently would not be expected to induce lactose intolerance.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            The recommended starting dosage of Acarbose is 25 mg given orally three times daily at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal. However, some patients may benefit from more gradual dose titration to minimize gastrointestinal side effects. This may be achieved by initiating treatment at 25 mg once per day and subsequently increasing the frequency of administration to achieve 25 mg t.i.d. Maintenance Dosage Once a 25 mg t.i.d. dosage regimen is reached, dosage of Acarbose should be adjusted at 4–8 week intervals based on one-hour postprandial glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and on tolerance. The dosage can be increased from 25 mg t.i.d. to 50 mg t.i.d. Some patients may benefit from further increasing the dosage to 100 mg t.i.d. The maintenance dose ranges from 50 mg t.i.d. to 100 mg t.i.d.

Interaction





                            Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of blood glucose control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel-blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving Acaril, the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from patients receiving Acaril in combination with sulfonylureas or insulin, patients should be observed closely for any evidence of hypoglycemia.
Patients Receiving Sulfonylureas or Insulin: Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause hypoglycemia. Acaril given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin may cause a further lowering of blood glucose and may increase the potential for hypoglycemia. If hypoglycemia occurs, appropriate adjustments in the dosage of these agents should be made. Very rarely, individual cases of hypoglycemic shock have been reported in patients receiving Acaril therapy in combination with sulfonylureas and/or insulin.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Acarbose is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug. Precose is contraindicated in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or cirrhosis. Acarbose is also contraindicated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, colonic ulceration, partial intestinal obstruction or in patients predisposed to intestinal obstruction. In addition, Acarbose is contraindicated in patients who have chronic intestinal diseases associated with marked disorders of digestion or absorption and in patients who have conditions that may deteriorate as a result of increased gas formation in the intestine.
                    










Side Effects





                            Diarrhea, gas, upset stomach, constipation, or stomach pain may occur in the first few weeks of treatment as your body adjusts to this medication but usually improve with time. Follow your prescribed diet to help lessen these side effects. If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy Category B. The safety of Acarbose in pregnant women has not been established. A small amount of radioactivity has been found in the milk of lactating rats after administration of radiolabeled acarbose. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, Acarbose should not be administered to a nursing woman.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Because of its mechanism of action, Acaril when administered alone should not cause hypoglycemia in the fasted or postprandial state. Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause hypoglycemia. Because Acaril given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin will cause a further lowering of blood glucose, it may increase the potential for hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, and no increased incidence of hypoglycemia was observed in patients when Acaril was added to metformin therapy.
Oral glucose (dextrose), whose absorption is not inhibited by Acaril, should be used instead of sucrose (cane sugar) in the treatment of mild to moderate hypoglycemia. Sucrose, whose hydrolysis to glucose and fructose is inhibited by Acaril, is unsuitable for the rapid correction of hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia may require the use of either intravenous glucose infusion or glucagon injection.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: safety and effectiveness of Acaril in pediatric patients have not been established.
Geriatric Use
: of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Acaril in the United States, 27% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Unlike sulfonylureas or insulin, an overdose of Acaril will not result in hypoglycemia. An overdose may result in transient increases in flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort which shortly subside.

Indications





                            Accolate is indicated for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in adults and children 5 years of age and older.

Pharmacology





                            Zafirlukast is a selective and competitive leukotriene-receptor antagonist (LTRA) of leukotriene D4 and E4 (LTD4 and LTE4), components of slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRSA). Cysteinyl leukotriene production and receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma, including airway oedema, smooth muscle constriction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            Zafirlukast should be taken continuously. 
Children under 7 years of age:
 There is no clinical experience of the use of Zafirlukast in children under 7 years of age until safety information is available.
Children over 7 years through 11 years of age
: The recommended dose of Zafirlukast in this age group is 10 mg twice daily.
Adult and children aged 12 years and over
: The dosage is one 20 mg tablet twice daily. This dosage should not be exceeded. Higher doses may be associated with elevations of one or more liver enzymes consistent with hepatotoxicity. As food may reduce the bioavailability of Zafirlukast, Zafirlukast should not be taken with meals
Elderly
: The clearance of Zafirlukast is significantly reduced in elderly patients (over 65 years old), and Cmax and AUC are approximately double than those of younger adults. However, accumulation of Zafirlukast is not greater than that seen in multiple dose trials conducted in adult subjects with asthma and the consequences of the altered kinetic in the elderly are unknown. Clinical experience with Zafirlukast in the elderly (over 65 years) is limited and caution is recommended until further information is available.
Renal impairment
: No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment.

Interaction





                            Accolate may be administered with other therapies routinely used in the management of asthma and allergy. Inhaled steroids, inhaled and oral bronchodilator therapy, antibiotics and antihistamines are examples of agents which have been co-administered with Accolate without adverse interaction.
Accolate may be administered with oral contraceptives without adverse interaction. Co-administration with Warfarin results in an increase in maximum prothrombin time by approximately 35%. It is therefore recommended that if Accolate is co-administered with Warfarin, prothrombin time should be closely monitored. The interaction is probably due to an inhibition by Accolate of the cytochrome P450 2C9 enzyme system. In clinical trials co-administration with Theophylline resulted in decreased plasma levels of Accolate, by approximately 30%, but with no effect on plasma Theophylline levels. However, during postmarketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of patients experiencing increased Theophylline levels when co-administered with Accolate.
Co-administration with Terfenadine resulted in a 54% decrease in AUC for Accolate, but with no effect on plasma Terfenadine levels. Coadministration with Acetylsalicylic acid (650 mg four times a day) may result in increased plasma levels of Accolate, by approximately 45%.
Co-administration with Erythromycin will result in decreased plasma levels of Accolate, by approximately 40%. The clearance of Accolate in smokers may be increased by approximately 20%
                    




















Contraindications





                            Zafirlukast should not be given to patients who have previously experienced hypersensitivity to the product or any of its ingredients. Zafirlukast is contraindicated in patients with a history of moderate or severe renal impairment. Zafirlukast is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment or cirrhosis; it has not been studied in patients with hepatitis or in long term studies of patients with cirrhosis. Zafirlukast is contraindicated in children under 7 years of age until safety information is available.
                    










Side Effects






Effect on ability to drive or operate machinery
: There is no evidence that Accolate affects the ability to drive and use machinery. Administration of Accolate in clinical trials against placebo has been associated with headache (9.9% vs. 9.0%) or gastrointestinal disturbance (nausea 2.6% vs. 2.2%, vomiting 1.2% vs. 1.0%, diarrhoea 2.3% vs. 1.8%, abdominal pain 1.6% vs. 1.2%). These symptoms are usually mild and do not necessitate withdrawal from therapy. During post-marketing experience, bruising, bleeding disorders, including menorrhagia (rare), thrombocytopaenia and agranulocytosis (very rare) have also been reported.
Hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria and angio-oedema have been reported. Rashes, including blistering, have also been reported. The above events have usually resolved during continued treatment or following cessation of therapy. 
Infrequently, elevated serum transaminase levels have been observed in clinical trials against placebo with Accolate (increased AST 1.0% vs. 0.9%, increased AST 0.6% vs. 0.6%); at recommended doses the incidence was equivalent to placebo. Rarely the transaminase profile has been consistent with drug-induced hepatitis, which resolved following cessation of Accolate therapy. During post-marketing experience there have been rare reports of hepatitis, with or without elevated bilirubin levels. These cases were usually reversible.
In placebo controlled clinical trials, an increased incidence of infection has been observed in elderly patients given Accolate (7.8% vs. 1.4%). Infections were usually mild, predominantly affecting the respiratory tract.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation






Pregnancy
: The safety of Zafirlukast in human pregnancy has not been established. In animal studies, Zafirlukast did not have any apparent effect on fertility and did not appear to have any teratogenic or selective toxic effect on the foetus. The potential risks should be weighed against the benefits of continuing therapy during pregnancy and Zafirlukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.
Lactation
: Zafirlukast is excreted in human breast milk. Zafirlukast should not be administered to nursing mothers.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Accolate should be taken regularly to achieve benefit, even during symptom free periods. Accolate therapy should normally be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. Accolate does not allow a reduction in existing steroid treatment. As with inhaled steroids and hormones (disodium cromoglycate, nedocromil sodium), Accolate is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks. Accolate has not been evaluated in the treatment of labile (brittle) or unstable asthma.
Cases of Churg Strauss syndrome have been reported in association with Accolate usage. A causal relationship has neither been confirmed nor refuted. If a patient develops a Churg Strauss syndrome type illness, Accolate should be stopped, a re-challenge test should not be performed and treatment should not be restarted.
Elevations in serum transaminases can occur during treatment with Accolate. These are usually asymptomatic and transient but could represent early evidence of hepatotoxicity.
If clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of liver dysfunction occur (e.g., nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, fatigue, lethargy, flu-like symptoms, enlarged liver, pruritus and jaundice), the serum transaminases, in particular serum ALT, should be measured and the patient managed accordingly. A decision to discontinue Accolate should be individualized to the patient’s condition, weighing the risk of hepatic dysfunction against the clinical benefit of Accolate to the patient.

A glucose meter, also referred to as a ""glucometer"", is a medical device for determining the approximate concentration of glucose in the blood. It can also be a strip of glucose paper dipped into a substance and measured to the glucose chart. It is a key element of glucose testing, including home blood glucose monitoring (HBGM) performed by people with diabetes mellitus or hypoglycemia. A small drop of blood, obtained from slightly piercing a fingertip with a lancet, is placed on a disposable test strip that the meter reads and uses to calculate the blood glucose level. The meter then displays the level in units of mg/dL or mmol/L.
Since approximately 1980, a primary goal of the management of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus has been achieving closer-to-normal levels of glucose in the blood for as much of the time as possible, guided by HBGM several times a day. The benefits include a reduction in the occurrence rate and severity of long-term complications from hyperglycemia as well as a reduction in the short-term, potentially life-threatening complications of hypoglycemia.

Description






How to choose blood glucose meter
: If you have diabetes, you'll likely need a blood glucose meter to measure and display the amount of sugar (glucose) in your blood. Exercise, food, medications, stress and other factors affect your blood glucose level. Using a blood glucose meter can help you better manage your diabetes by tracking any fluctuations in your blood glucose level.
Many types of blood glucose meters are available, from basic models to more-advanced meters with multiple features and options. The cost of blood glucose meters and test strips varies, as does insurance coverage. Study your options before deciding which model to buy.
Choosing the right meter
: When selecting a blood glucose meter, it can help to know the basics of how they work. To use most blood glucose meters, you first insert a test strip into the device. Then with a special needle, you poke a clean fingertip to get a drop of blood. You carefully touch the test strip to the blood and wait for a blood glucose reading to appear on the screen.
When used and stored properly, blood glucose meters are generally accurate in how they measure glucose. They differ in the type and number of features they offer. Here are several factors to consider when choosing a blood glucose meter:




Insurance coverage. Check with your insurance provider for coverage details. Some insurance providers limit coverage to specific models or limit the total number of test strips allowed.


Cost. Meters vary in price. Be sure to factor in the cost of the test strips, as these will represent the majority of the cost in the long term.


Ease of use. Some meters are easier to use than others. Are both the meter and test strips comfortable and easy to hold? Can you easily see the numbers on the screen? How easy is it to get blood onto the strips? How much blood is required?


Special features. Ask about the features to see what meets your specific needs. Special features may include large, easy-to-handle buttons and test strips, illuminated screens, and audio, which may be useful for people with impaired vision.


Information storage and retrieval. Consider how the meter stores and retrieves information. Some can track time and date of a test, the result, and trends over time. Some meters offer the ability to share your readings in real time with your healthcare provider with a smartphone app. Or some may offer the option to download your blood glucose readings to a computer, then email the test results to your doctor.


Support. Most meter manufacturers include a toll-free number that you can call for help. Look for a meter that includes clear instructions that demonstrate the correct way to use the meter. Some manufacturers offer users manuals on their websites.

A glucose meter, also referred to as a ""glucometer"", is a medical device for determining the approximate concentration of glucose in the blood. It can also be a strip of glucose paper dipped into a substance and measured to the glucose chart. It is a key element of glucose testing, including home blood glucose monitoring (HBGM) performed by people with diabetes mellitus or hypoglycemia. A small drop of blood, obtained from slightly piercing a fingertip with a lancet, is placed on a disposable test strip that the meter reads and uses to calculate the blood glucose level. The meter then displays the level in units of mg/dL or mmol/L.
Since approximately 1980, a primary goal of the management of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus has been achieving closer-to-normal levels of glucose in the blood for as much of the time as possible, guided by HBGM several times a day. The benefits include a reduction in the occurrence rate and severity of long-term complications from hyperglycemia as well as a reduction in the short-term, potentially life-threatening complications of hypoglycemia.

Description






How to choose blood glucose meter
: If you have diabetes, you'll likely need a blood glucose meter to measure and display the amount of sugar (glucose) in your blood. Exercise, food, medications, stress and other factors affect your blood glucose level. Using a blood glucose meter can help you better manage your diabetes by tracking any fluctuations in your blood glucose level.
Many types of blood glucose meters are available, from basic models to more-advanced meters with multiple features and options. The cost of blood glucose meters and test strips varies, as does insurance coverage. Study your options before deciding which model to buy.
Choosing the right meter
: When selecting a blood glucose meter, it can help to know the basics of how they work. To use most blood glucose meters, you first insert a test strip into the device. Then with a special needle, you poke a clean fingertip to get a drop of blood. You carefully touch the test strip to the blood and wait for a blood glucose reading to appear on the screen.
When used and stored properly, blood glucose meters are generally accurate in how they measure glucose. They differ in the type and number of features they offer. Here are several factors to consider when choosing a blood glucose meter:




Insurance coverage. Check with your insurance provider for coverage details. Some insurance providers limit coverage to specific models or limit the total number of test strips allowed.


Cost. Meters vary in price. Be sure to factor in the cost of the test strips, as these will represent the majority of the cost in the long term.


Ease of use. Some meters are easier to use than others. Are both the meter and test strips comfortable and easy to hold? Can you easily see the numbers on the screen? How easy is it to get blood onto the strips? How much blood is required?


Special features. Ask about the features to see what meets your specific needs. Special features may include large, easy-to-handle buttons and test strips, illuminated screens, and audio, which may be useful for people with impaired vision.


Information storage and retrieval. Consider how the meter stores and retrieves information. Some can track time and date of a test, the result, and trends over time. Some meters offer the ability to share your readings in real time with your healthcare provider with a smartphone app. Or some may offer the option to download your blood glucose readings to a computer, then email the test results to your doctor.


Support. Most meter manufacturers include a toll-free number that you can call for help. Look for a meter that includes clear instructions that demonstrate the correct way to use the meter. Some manufacturers offer users manuals on their websites.

Storage Conditions





                            Store the test strip container and meter in a cool, dry place such as a bedroom. Refer to the test strip package insert for test strip storage and system operating conditions.

Pharmacology





                            Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility.
Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.
Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:




Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms
: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes


Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms
: Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae


Other microorganisms
: Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Betalactamase production should have no effect on azithromycin activity.


Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms
: Streptococci (Groups C,F,G), Viridans group streptococci


Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms
: Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila


Anaerobic microorganisms
: Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella bivia




























Dosage






Oral
-
Adult
: 500 mg once daily orally for 3 days or 500 mg once on day 1, then 250 mg once on days 2-5 for 4 days. For sexually transmitted diseases caused by Chlamydia trachomatis in adults, the dose is 1 gm given as a single dose or 500 mg once on day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily for next 2 days may also be given.
Children
:




10 mg/kg body weight once daily for 3 days for child over 6 months


200 mg (1 teaspoonful) for 3 days if body weight is 15-25 kg


300 mg (1½ teaspoonfuls) for 3 days if body weight is 26-35 kg; 400 mg (2 teaspoonfuls) for 3 days if body weight is 36-45 kg.


In typhoid fever, 500 mg (2½ teaspoonfuls) once daily for 7-10 days is given.




Azithromycin Injection (For IV Infusion only)
: The recommended dose of Azithromycin for injection for the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia due to the indicated organisms is:




500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for at least two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by Azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 500 mg, administered as two 250-mg tablets to complete a 7 to 10-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response.


The recommended dose of Azithromycin for the treatment of adult patients with pelvic inflammatory disease due to the indicated organisms is: 500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for one or two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by Azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 250 mg to complete a 7-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response. If anaerobic microorganisms are suspected of contributing to the infection, an antimicrobial agent with anaerobic activity should be administered in combination with Azithromycin.


Safety and effectiveness of azithromycin for injection in children or adolescents under 16 years have not been established.

Interaction






Antacid
: In patients receiving azithromycin and antacids, azithromycin should be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the antacid. Carbamazepine: In a pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers, no significant effect was observed on the plasma levels of carbamazepine or its active metabolite. 
Cyclosporin
: Some of the related macrolide antibiotics interfere with the metabolism of cyclosporin. In the absence of conclusive data from pharmacokinetic studies or clinical data investigating potential interactions between azithromycin and cyclosporine, caution should be exercised before co-administration of these two drugs. If coadministrations is necessary, cyclosporin levels should be monitored and the dose adjusted accordingly. 
Digoxin
: Some of the macrolide antibiotics have been reported to impair the metabolism of digoxin (in the gut) in some patients. Therefore, in patients receiving concomitant azithromycin and digoxin the possibility of raised digoxin levels should be borne in mind and digoxin levels monitored. 
Ergot derivatives
: Because of the theoretical possibility of ergotism, azithromycin and ergot derivatives should not be co-administered. 
Methylprednisolone
: In a pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers, azithromycin had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of methylprednisolone. 
Theophylline
: There is no evidence of any pharmacokinetic interaction when azithromycin and theophylline are co-administered to healthy volunteers. In general, however, theophylline levels should be monitored. 
Warfarin
: In a pharmacodynamic interaction study, azithromycin did not alter the anticoagulant effect of a single 15 mg dose of warfarin administered to healthy volunteers. Accuzith and warfarin may be co-administered, but monitoring of the prothrombin time should be continued as routinely performed. 
Terfenadine
: Accuzith did not affect the pharmacokinetics of terfenadine administered at the recommended dose of 60 mg every 12 hours. Addition of azithromycin did not result in any significant changes in cardiac repolarisation (QTc interval) measured during the steady state dosing of terfenadine.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Azithromycin Dihydrate is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to Azithromycin or any other macrolide antibiotic. Co-administration of ergot derivatives and Azithromycin is contraindicated. Azithromycin is contraindicated in patients with hepatic diseases.
                    










Side Effects





                            Accuzith is well tolerated with a low incidence of side-effects. Most side-effects observed were mild to moderate in severity. The majority of side-effects were gastrointestinal in origin with nauseas, abdominal discomfort (pain/cramps), vomiting, flatulence, diarrhoea and loose stools being occasionally observed. Allergic reactions such as rash or photosensitivity have occurred and there have also been rare reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions. Reversible elevations in liver transaminases have been seen with a frequency similar to the comparative macrolides and penicillins used in clinical trials. Rarely, cases of cholestatic jaundice have been observed. Transient mild reductions in neutrofil counts have occasionally been observed in clinical trials, although a causal relationship to azithromycin has not been established. Hearing impairment: In investigational studies where higher doses were used for prolonged periods of time, reversible hearing impairment was seen in some patients.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy Category of Azithromycin Dihydrate is B. Animal reproduction studies have demonstrated that Azithromycin has no evidence of harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Since animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if adequate alternatives are not available. It is not known whether Azithromycin is secreted in breast milk. So, caution should be exercised when Azithromycin is administered to nursing women.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            As with erythromycin and other macrolides, rare serious allergic reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylaxis, has been reported. Some of these reactions with azithromycin have resulted in recurrent symptoms and required a long period of observation and treatment.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Use in renal impairment
: No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance >40 ml/min), but there are no data regarding azithromycin in patients with more severe renal impairment, thus caution should be exercised in using azithromycin in these patients.
Use in hepatic impairment
: As the liver is the principal route of excretion of azithromycin, it should not be used in patients with hepatic disease.
Effects on ability to drive and use machines
: There is no evidence to suggest that azithromycin may have an effect on a patient’s ability to drive or operate machinery.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            There is no data on overdosage with Accuzith. Typical symptoms of overdosage with macrolide antibiotics include hearing loss, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Gastric lavage and general supportive measures are indicated.
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Keep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.

Pharmacology





                            Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility.
Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.
Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:

Pharmacology





                            Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat

Interaction





                            Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Ace. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Ace overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Ace levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of Ace are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care is advised in the administration of Ace to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Ace-containing products concurrently. Ace should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of Ace in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Ace. Use caution when administering Ace in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Ace IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Ace IV in patients with Ace allergy.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of Ace IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Ace IV in adults.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
: Ace is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Ace may be warranted.
Patients with Renal Impairment
: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Ace may be warranted.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Ace. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Ace may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms
: Symptoms of Ace overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.

The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Ace-containing products concurrently. Ace should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of Ace in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Ace. Use caution when administering Ace in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Ace IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Ace IV in patients with Ace allergy.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of Ace IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Ace IV in adults.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
: Ace is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Ace may be warranted.
Patients with Renal Impairment
: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Ace may be warranted.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Ace. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Ace may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms
: Symptoms of Ace overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.

Pharmacology





                            Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat

Interaction





                            Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Ace. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Ace overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Ace levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of Ace are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care is advised in the administration of Ace to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Ace-containing products concurrently. Ace should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of Ace in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Ace. Use caution when administering Ace in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Ace IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Ace IV in patients with Ace allergy.

Pharmacology





                            Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat

Interaction





                            Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Ace. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Ace overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Ace levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of Ace are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care is advised in the administration of Ace to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Ace-containing products concurrently. Ace should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of Ace in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Ace. Use caution when administering Ace in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Ace IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Ace IV in patients with Ace allergy.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of Ace IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Ace IV in adults.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
: Ace is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Ace may be warranted.
Patients with Renal Impairment
: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Ace may be warranted.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Ace. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Ace may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms
: Symptoms of Ace overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.

                            Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat

Interaction





                            Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Ace. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Ace overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Ace levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of Ace are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care is advised in the administration of Ace to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Ace-containing products concurrently. Ace should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of Ace in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Ace. Use caution when administering Ace in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Ace IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Ace IV in patients with Ace allergy.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of Ace IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Ace IV in adults.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
: Ace is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Ace may be warranted.
Patients with Renal Impairment
: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Ace may be warranted.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Ace. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Ace may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms
: Symptoms of Ace overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital.

Pharmacology





                            Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat

Interaction





                            Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Ace. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Ace overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Ace levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of Ace are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care is advised in the administration of Ace to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Ace-containing products concurrently. Ace should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of Ace in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Ace. Use caution when administering Ace in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Ace IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Ace IV in patients with Ace allergy.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of Ace IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Ace IV in adults.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
: Ace is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Ace may be warranted.
Patients with Renal Impairment
: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Ace may be warranted.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Ace. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Ace may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms
: Symptoms of Ace overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.

Interaction





                            Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Ace. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Ace overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Ace levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of Ace are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care is advised in the administration of Ace to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Ace-containing products concurrently. Ace should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of Ace in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Ace. Use caution when administering Ace in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Ace IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Ace IV in patients with Ace allergy.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of Ace IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Ace IV in adults.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
: Ace is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Ace may be warranted.
Patients with Renal Impairment
: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Ace may be warranted.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Ace. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Ace may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms
: Symptoms of Ace overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.

Pharmacology





                            Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat

Pharmacology





                            This is a combination of Paracetamol and Caffeine. Paracetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Caffeine is an alkaloid which is a theophylline-like xanthine derivative. By intermolecular association with Paracetamol, Caffeine increases the solubility and transmembrane permeation of Paracetamol. In addition, Caffeine increases the pain threshold and tolerance of pain. Caffeine has also an intrinsic power to raise vessel tone in the brain, which provides another benefit to treat migraine and headache.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adult dose
: 1-2 tablets every 4-6 hours. Maximum dose: 8 tablets daily. 
Child dose
: Not recommended for children below 12 years.

Pharmacology





                            Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat

Interaction





                            Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Ace Power. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Ace Power overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Ace Power levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of Ace Power are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care is advised in the administration of Ace Power to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Ace Power-containing products concurrently. Ace Power should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of Ace Power in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Ace Power. Use caution when administering Ace Power in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Ace Power IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Ace Power IV in patients with Ace Power allergy.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of Ace Power IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Ace Power IV in adults.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
: Ace Power is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Ace Power may be warranted.
Patients with Renal Impairment
: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Ace Power may be warranted.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Ace Power. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Ace Power may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms
: Symptoms of Ace Power overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace Power overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace Power concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace Power. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.

Pharmacology





                            Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat

Interaction





                            Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Ace XR. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Ace XR overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Ace XR levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of Ace XR are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care is advised in the administration of Ace XR to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Ace XR-containing products concurrently. Ace XR should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of Ace XR in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Ace XR. Use caution when administering Ace XR in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Ace XR IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Ace XR IV in patients with Ace XR allergy.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of Ace XR IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Ace XR IV in adults.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
: Ace XR is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Ace XR may be warranted.
Patients with Renal Impairment
: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Ace XR may be warranted.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Ace XR. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Ace XR may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms
: Symptoms of Ace XR overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace XR overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace XR concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace XR. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.

Pharmacology





                            Ramipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which after hydrolysis to ramiprilat, blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. So, inhibition of ACE by ramipril results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Thus ramipril exerts its antihypertensive activity. It is also effective in the management of heart failure and reduction of the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular events. It is long acting and well tolerated; so, can be used in long term therapy.
                    
























Dosage





                            Dosage of Ramipril must be adjusted according to the patient tolerance and response.
Hypertension
: For the management of hypertension in adults not receiving a diuretic, the usual initial dose of Ramipril is 1.25-2.5 mg once daily. Dosage generally is adjusted no more rapidly than at 2 week intervals. The usual maintenance dosage in adults is 2.5-20 mg daily given as a single dose or in 2 divided doses daily. If BP is not controlled with Ramipril alone, a diuretic may be added.
Congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction
: In this case, Ramipril therapy may be initiated as early as 2 days after myocardial infarction. An initial dose of 2.5 mg twice daily is recommended, but if hypotension occurs, dose should be reduced to 1.25 mg twice daily. Therapy is then titrated to a target daily dose of 5 mg twice daily. 
Prevention of major cardiovascular events
: In this case, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg once daily for the first week of therapy and 5 mg once daily for the following 3 weeks; dosage then may be increased, as tolerated, to a maintenance dosage of 10 mg once daily.
Dosage in renal impairment
: 




For patients with hypertension and renal impairment
: The recommended initial dose is 1.25 mg Ramipril once daily. Subsequent dosage should be titrated according to individual tolerance and BP response, up to a maximum of 5 mg daily.


For patients with heart failure and renal impairment
: The recommended dose is 1.25 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to 1.25 mg twice daily and up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg twice daily depending upon clinical response and tolerability.

Administration





                            Ramipril tablets have to be swallowed with sufficient amounts of liquid. The tablets must not be chewed or crushed. Absorption of Ramipril is not significantly affected by food. Ramipril may, therefore, be taken before, during or after a meal.

Interaction





                            Concomitant administration with diuretics may lead to serious hypotension and in addition dangerous hyperkalemia with potassium sparing diuretics. Concomitant therapy with lithium may increase the serum lithium concentration. Reduction in BP may affect the ability to drive and operate machinery and this may be exacerbated by alcohol. NSAIDs may reduce the antihypertensive effect of Acecard and cause deterioration of renal function.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Ramipril must not be used

during pregnancy.



Concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and extracorporeal treatments leading to contact of blood with negatively charged surfaces must be avoided, since such use may lead to severe anaphylactoid reactions. Such extracorporeal treatments include dialysis or haemofiltration with certain high-fux (e.g. polyacrylonitril) membranes and low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate.
                    










Side Effects





                            Acecard is generally well tolerated. Dizziness, headache, fatigue and asthenia are commonly reported side effects. Other side effects occurring less frequently include symptomatic hypotension, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, urticaria, oliguria, anxiety, amnesia etc. Angioneurotic oedema, anaphylactic reactions and hyperkalaemia have also been reported rarely.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Ramipril must not be taken during pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy must be excluded before starting treatment. Pregnancy must be avoided in cases where treatment with ACE inhibitors is indispensable. If the patient intends to become pregnant, treatment with ACE inhibitors must be discontinued, i.e. replaced by another form of treatment. If the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, medication with Ramipril must be replaced as soon as possible by a treatment regimen without ACE inhibitors. Otherwise, there is a risk of harm to the fetus. Ramipril is not recommended during breastfeeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Acecard should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, and impaired hepatic function.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Elderly
: A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Acecard daily must be considered.
Hepatic impairment
: Treatment in these patients must therefore be initiated only under close medical supervision. The maximum permitted daily dose in such cases is 2.5 mg Acecard.
Renal impairment
: With a creatinine clearance between 50 and 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area, the initial daily dose is generally 1.25 mg Acecard. The maximum permitted daily dose, in this case, is 5 mg Acecard. Patients with incompletely corrected fuid or salt depletion, in patients with severe hypertension, as well as in patients in whom a hypotensive reaction would constitute a particular risk, (e.g., with relevant stenoses of the coronary vessels or those supplying the brain) A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Acecard daily must be considered.
Patients pretreated with a diuretic
: Consideration must be given to discontinuing the diuretic for at least 2 to 3 days or- depending on the duration of action of the diuretic- longer before starting treatment with Acecard, or at least to reducing the diuretic dose. The initial daily dose in patients previously treated with a diuretic is generally 1.25 mg Acecard.
                    








Overdose Effects






Sign and symptom
: Overdosage may cause excessive peripheral vasodilatation (with marked hypotension, shock), bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances, and renal failure.
Management
: Primary detoxifcation by, for example, gastric lavage, administration of adsorbents, sodium sulfate; (if possible during the frst 30 minutes). In the event of hypotension administration of α1-adrenergic agonists (e.g. norepinephrine, dopamine) or angiotensin II (angiotensinamide), which is usually available only in scattered research laboratories, must be considered in addition to volume and salt substitution.

Pharmacology





                            Ramipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which after hydrolysis to ramiprilat, blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. So, inhibition of ACE by ramipril results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Thus ramipril exerts its antihypertensive activity. It is also effective in the management of heart failure and reduction of the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular events. It is long acting and well tolerated; so, can be used in long term therapy.
                    
























Dosage





                            Dosage of Ramipril must be adjusted according to the patient tolerance and response.
Hypertension
: For the management of hypertension in adults not receiving a diuretic, the usual initial dose of Ramipril is 1.25-2.5 mg once daily. Dosage generally is adjusted no more rapidly than at 2 week intervals. The usual maintenance dosage in adults is 2.5-20 mg daily given as a single dose or in 2 divided doses daily. If BP is not controlled with Ramipril alone, a diuretic may be added.
Congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction
: In this case, Ramipril therapy may be initiated as early as 2 days after myocardial infarction. An initial dose of 2.5 mg twice daily is recommended, but if hypotension occurs, dose should be reduced to 1.25 mg twice daily. Therapy is then titrated to a target daily dose of 5 mg twice daily. 
Prevention of major cardiovascular events
: In this case, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg once daily for the first week of therapy and 5 mg once daily for the following 3 weeks; dosage then may be increased, as tolerated, to a maintenance dosage of 10 mg once daily.
Dosage in renal impairment
: 




For patients with hypertension and renal impairment
: The recommended initial dose is 1.25 mg Ramipril once daily. Subsequent dosage should be titrated according to individual tolerance and BP response, up to a maximum of 5 mg daily.


For patients with heart failure and renal impairment
: The recommended dose is 1.25 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to 1.25 mg twice daily and up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg twice daily depending upon clinical response and tolerability.

Administration





                            Ramipril tablets have to be swallowed with sufficient amounts of liquid. The tablets must not be chewed or crushed. Absorption of Ramipril is not significantly affected by food. Ramipril may, therefore, be taken before, during or after a meal.

Interaction





                            Concomitant administration with diuretics may lead to serious hypotension and in addition dangerous hyperkalemia with potassium sparing diuretics. Concomitant therapy with lithium may increase the serum lithium concentration. Reduction in BP may affect the ability to drive and operate machinery and this may be exacerbated by alcohol. NSAIDs may reduce the antihypertensive effect of Acecard and cause deterioration of renal function.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Ramipril must not be used

The maximum permitted daily dose, in this case, is 5 mg Acecard. Patients with incompletely corrected fuid or salt depletion, in patients with severe hypertension, as well as in patients in whom a hypotensive reaction would constitute a particular risk, (e.g., with relevant stenoses of the coronary vessels or those supplying the brain) A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Acecard daily must be considered.
Patients pretreated with a diuretic
: Consideration must be given to discontinuing the diuretic for at least 2 to 3 days or- depending on the duration of action of the diuretic- longer before starting treatment with Acecard, or at least to reducing the diuretic dose. The initial daily dose in patients previously treated with a diuretic is generally 1.25 mg Acecard.
                    








Overdose Effects






Sign and symptom
: Overdosage may cause excessive peripheral vasodilatation (with marked hypotension, shock), bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances, and renal failure.
Management
: Primary detoxifcation by, for example, gastric lavage, administration of adsorbents, sodium sulfate; (if possible during the frst 30 minutes). In the event of hypotension administration of α1-adrenergic agonists (e.g. norepinephrine, dopamine) or angiotensin II (angiotensinamide), which is usually available only in scattered research laboratories, must be considered in addition to volume and salt substitution.

Composition





                            Each tablet contains-




Dried Aluminium Hydroxide Gel BP (Al2O3 47%, minimum): 250 mg


Magnesium Hydroxide BP: 400 mg



Each 5 ml contains-




Aluminium Oxide (Equivalent amount of Aluminium Hydroxide Gel USP): 175 mg


Magnesium Hydroxide (Equivalent amount of Magnesium Hydroxide Paste USP): 225 mg




































Pharmacology





                            This drug is well-balanced combination of essential non-systemic antacids which excel in efficacy and palatability. These are dependable antacid preparations without acid rebound, constipating or cathertic effects. Both the preparations provide symptomatic relief of hyperacidity associated with heartburn, acid ingestion or sour stomach.
Aluminium hydroxide gel, a slow acting antacid and an adsorbent with prolonged effect, has high neutralizing power. Magnesium Hydroxide possesses a slow but sustained acid neutralizing property. Antacids of both tablet and suspension possess adsorbent property. They form a protecting coating over the ulcer surface facilitating its healing; thus protecting the sensitive mucosa of stomach and duodenum from further irritation.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Tablet
: Two tablets 1-3 hours after meal and at bed time or as directed by the physician.
Suspension
: 2 tea spoonful 1-3 hours after meal and at bed time or as directed by the physician.

Interaction





                            Acedone-Z inhibits the absorption of following drugs: Azithromycin, cefpodoxime, ciprofloxacin, isoniazid, rifampicin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, pivampicillin, tetracyclines, Gabapentin and phenytoin, Itraconazole, ketoconazole, Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and Phenothiazines.
                    




















Contraindications





                            This is contraindicated in hypophosphataemia. It is also contraindicated in alkalosis and hypermagnesaemia where abdominal distention may be due to partial or complete intestinal obstruction.
                    










Side Effects





                            Long term use of any antacid results in alkaluria, which may predispose to nephrolithiasis by forming precipitation of calcium phosphate.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            It is advised to avoid antacid preparations in the first trimester of pregnancy.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Antacids reduce the absorption of tetracycline when given concomitantly. These should not be used concomitantly
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Antacids
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Keep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.

Magnesium Hydroxide (Equivalent amount of Magnesium Hydroxide Paste USP): 225 mg




































Pharmacology





                            This drug is well-balanced combination of essential non-systemic antacids which excel in efficacy and palatability. These are dependable antacid preparations without acid rebound, constipating or cathertic effects. Both the preparations provide symptomatic relief of hyperacidity associated with heartburn, acid ingestion or sour stomach.
Aluminium hydroxide gel, a slow acting antacid and an adsorbent with prolonged effect, has high neutralizing power. Magnesium Hydroxide possesses a slow but sustained acid neutralizing property. Antacids of both tablet and suspension possess adsorbent property. They form a protecting coating over the ulcer surface facilitating its healing; thus protecting the sensitive mucosa of stomach and duodenum from further irritation.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Tablet
: Two tablets 1-3 hours after meal and at bed time or as directed by the physician.
Suspension
: 2 tea spoonful 1-3 hours after meal and at bed time or as directed by the physician.

Composition





                            Each tablet contains-




Dried Aluminium Hydroxide Gel BP (Al2O3, 47% minimum): 425.53 mg


Magnesium Hydroxide BP: 400 mg


Simethicone USP: 30 mg



Each 5 ml contains-




Aluminium Oxide (Equivalent amount of Aluminium Hydroxide Gel USP): 200 mg


Magnesium Hydroxide (Equivalent amount of Magnesium Hydroxide Paste USP): 400 mg


Simethicone USP: 30 mg




































Pharmacology





                            This is the mixture of non-systemic acid neutralizing substances and antiflatulent. This preparation offers reliability as well as long action. Aluminium Hydroxide and Magnesium Hydroxide induce the relief of ulcer by neutralizing gastric acid secreted from parietal cells of the stomach. The clinical use of simethicone is based on its antifoam properties. Simethicone spreads on the surface of aqueous liquids, forming a film of low surface tension and causing collapse of foam bubbles. Simethicone repeatedly allows mucous surrounded gas bubbles in the GI tract to coalesce and be expelled.
This is used in the treatment of flatulence and meteorism for the elimination of gas, air or foam from the gastro-intestinal tract prior to radiography and for the relief of abdominal distension and dyspepsia. 
Simethicone is physiologically inert; it does not appeared to be absorbed from the GI tract to interfere with gastric secretion or absorption of nutrients. Following oral administration, the drug is excreted unchanged in the feces.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Tablet
: 1-2 tablets 1-3 hours after meal and at bed time or as directed by the physician.
Suspension
: 1-2 teaspoonful 1-3 hours after meal and at bedtime or as directed by the physician.

Interaction





                            All antacids may increase or decrease the rate and/or extent of absorption of concomitantly administered oral drugs. Antacids decrease the bioavailability of theophyline, tetracycline, quinolone antibiotics, isoniazide, ketoconazole, ethambutol, some antimuscarinic drugs, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, ranitidine, indomethacine, nitrofurantoin, fluoride, phosphate, propanolol, atenolol, digoxins, vitamins etc. Antacids increase the bioavailability of some drugs; e.g. sulphonamides, levodopa, valproic acid, enteric coated aspirin etc.
                    




















Contraindications





                            This should not be administered in patients with renal failure or hypophosphataemia or in those who are severely debilitated. It is also contraindicated in alkalosis and hypermagnesaemia, where abdominal distention may be due to partial or complete intestinal obstruction.
                    










Side Effects





                            Gastrointestinal side effects are uncommon. Occasionally, if excessive amount is consumed, diarrhea, constipation or regurgitation may occur.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            It is advised to avoid antacid preparations in the first trimester of pregnancy.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            This should be used with caution in patients with kidney disease.

Pharmacology





                            Cephradine is a semisynthetic broad spectrum bactericidal antibiotic, it is active against infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Both penicillinase producing and nonproducing staphylococci are sensitive to Cephradine. The main site of action of Cephradine is the cell wall of bacteria. Cell wall of sensitive organism contains peptidoglycan. Cephradine inhibits cross-linking process and as a result cell wall with many pores are formed, thus lysis of bacteria occur due to external osmotic pressure.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






For oral administration
-
Adults:




Urinary tract infections: 500mg four times daily or 1g twice daily. Infections which are severe or chronic may necessitate the administration of higher doses. Where complications arise including prostatitis and epididymitis continued intensive treatment is required.


Respiratory tract infections: 250 to 500mg four times daily or 500mg to 1g twice daily, dependent on the site and severity of the infection.


Skin and soft tissue infections: 250 to 500mg four times daily or 500mg to 1g twice daily, again dependent on the site and severity of the infection.



Children:




Total daily dose of 25 to 50mg/kg given in two or four equally divided doses.


Otitis media: Total daily dose of 75 to 100mg/kg given in divided doses 6 to 12 hourly.


Maximum daily dosage: 4 gm



Elderly: The normal adult dose is appropriate. Patients with impaired renal or hepatic function should be monitored during treatment.
For injectable administration
- 




Adult: The usual dose is 2-4 gm daily in four equally divided doses up to 8 gm daily. For prophylaxis a single preoperative dose of 1-2 gm intramuscularly or intravenously is given.


Children: The dose is 50-100 mg/kg daily in four equally divided doses, up to 300 mg/kg daily in severe infection.

Interaction





                            The concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides with Cefradine may increase the risk of kidney damage. Diuretics (e.g. frusemide, ethacrynic acid) and probenecid enhanced the possibility of renal toxicity.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Cephradine should not be used in patients with known or suspected hypersensitivity to cephalosporins.
                    










Side Effects





                            Limited essentially to gastro-intestinal disturbances and on occasions to hypersensitivity phenomena. The latter are more likely to occur in individuals, who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity and thos with a history of allergy, asthma, hay fever or urticaria. Skin reactions have occasionally been reported. Rare- Glossitis, heartburn, dizziness, tightness in the chest, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vaginitis, candida overgrowth. Skin and hypersensitivity reactions include urticaria, skin rashes, joint pains, oedema.




Blood and lymphatic system disorders- Unknown: blood disorders (including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anaemia and haemolytic anaemia)


Immune system disorders- Unknown: Fever, serum sickness like reactions, anaphylaxis


Psychiatric disorders- Unknown: Confusion, sleep disturbances


Nervous system disorders- Unknown: hyperactivity, hypertonia, dizziness, nervousness; Rarely: Headache


Hepatobiliary disorders- Frequency unknown: Liver, enzyme disturbances, transient hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice


Renal and urinary disorders- Unknown: Reversible interstitial nephritis


Investigations- Unknown: Elevation of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase.














Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Although animal studies have not demonstrated any teratogenicity, safety in pregnancy has not been established. Cephradine is excreted in breast milk and should be used with caution in lactating mothers. Since the medicine may cause dizziness, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles.
                    








Precautions & Warnings








Prolonged use of an anti-infective may result in the development of superinfection due to the emergence of resistant organisms.


Acefra should be administered with care to patients hypersensitive to penicillins because of the risk of cross-sensitivity between beta-lactam antibiotics.


Cephalosporin antibiotics may cause a positive result in Coombs’ testing. When Coombs testing is performed on neonates whose mothers received cephalosporins prior to labour, it should be noted that a positive result may be due to the drug.


Acefra may cause a false positive urine glucose result when Benedict’s or Fehling’s solutions or tablets such as Clinitest are used in the testing. This does not occur with enzyme-based tests (e.g. Clinistix, Diastix).


Dosage adjustment is necessary in renal impairment.


Acefra contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.












Use in Special Populations





                            Renal Impairment: The following doses are recommended (based on 500 mg every 6 hours) for patients not on haemodialysis:




CrCl: >20 ml/min: 500 mg every 6 hours


CrCl: 5-20 ml/min: 250 mg every 6 hours


CrCl: <5 ml/min: 250 mg every 50-70 hours.



Recommendations for patients on chronic, intermittent haemodialysis:




250 mg at the start of haemodialysis


250 mg 6 to 12 hours after the start


250 mg 36 to 48 hours after the start


250 mg at the start of the next haemodialysis session if more than 30 hours have elapsed since the last dose.



Additional Information for all patients Regardless of patient age or weight, higher doses of up to 1 gm four times daily may be required for infections which are chronic or severe. Treatment should continue for at least 2 to 3 days after symptoms have resolved or bacteria have been eradicated. To reduce the possibility of rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis resulting from infections with haemolytic streptococci, treatment should be continued for at least 10 days. Throughout treatment of chronic urinary tract infections and for several months thereafter, regular bacteriological and clinical monitoring is required. 
Doses below those recommended above should not be prescribed. Paediatric dosages should not exceed those specified for adults, regardless of severity of infection. It may be necessary to continue Acefra therapy for several weeks in persistent infections. Patients may be transferred from intramuscular/intravenous Acefra therapy to oral treatment at the same dosage level.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            The symptoms of Sefrad overdose are non-specific and are generally nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and gastric upsets. Treatment is mainly supportive although gastric lavage will be necessary if a large amount has been ingested.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            First generation Cephalosporins
                    








Storage Conditions

Pharmacology





                            Cephalexin is a semisynthetic analogue of Cephalosporin C. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymeric structure that provides the cell wall with mechanical stability. The final stage in the synthesis of peptidoglycan involves the completion of the cross-linking and the terminal glycine residue of the Pentaglycine Bridge is linked to the fourth residue of the pentapeptide (d-alanin). The transpeptidase enzyme that performs this step is inhibited by penicillins and cephalosporins. As a result the bacterial cell wall is weakened, the cell swells and then ruptures. Cephalexin is a first generation cephalosporin that is active by mouth.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adult
: 




The usual dose is 250 mg to 500 mg every 6 hour.


For skin and soft tissue infections, streptococcal pharyngitis and uncomplicated cystitis, in patients over 15 years of age: 500 mg of the drug may be administered every 12 hour.


In severe or deep seated infections the dose can be increased up to 3 g to 6 g daily.




Children
: The dosage range is 25-100 mg/kg/day in divided doses to a maximum of 4 g daily
Children's Weight Recommended Dose:




10 kg (22 Ibs)
: 62.5 mg to 125 mg qid or 125 mg to 250 mg bid


20 kg (44 Ibs)
: 125 mg to 250 mg qid or 250 mg to 500 mg bid


40 kg (88 Ibs)
: 250 mg to 500 mg qid or 500 mg to 1 g bid



For streptococcal pharyngitis, skin and soft tissue infections and in patients over 1 year of age the total daily dose may be divided and administered every 12 hour. In the therapy of otitis media 75-100 mg/kg/day in four divided doses may be required. In the treatment of β haemolytic streptococcal infections a therapeutic dosage of the drug should be given at least for 10 days.

Contraindications





                            Cephalen is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the cephalosporin group of antibiotics.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort. Symptoms of pseudomembranous colitis may appear either during or after antibiotic treatment. Skin rash, angio oedema, rise in serum aminotransferases, eosinophilia, neutropenia have been reported very rarely. Superinfection with resistant micro organisms, particularly candida may follow the treatment.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy Category B. Cefalexin may be used during pregnancy when it is considered essential. Cefalexin is found in the milk of nursing mothers, hence caution should be taken when it is administered to nursing mothers.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Cefalexin should be given with caution in patients with renal impairment. Under such condition, careful clinical observation should be made because safe dosage may be lower than the usually recommended. The urine of patients receiving Cefalexin may give a false positive reaction for glucose with copper reduction reagent. Positive results to Coombs’ test have been reported. Although there is no evidence of teratogenicity in animal tests, Cefalexin may be used during pregnancy when it is considered essential. Cefalexin is found in the milk of nursing mothers, hence caution should be taken when it is administered to nursing mothers.

Indications





                            Acemox is indicated in open angle glaucoma, secondary glaucoma and as an adjuvant in the treatment of edema and epilepsy.

Pharmacology





                            Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible reaction involving the hydration of carbon-di-oxide and the dehydration of carbonic acid. In the eye, this inhibitory action of Acetazolamide decreases the secretion of aqueous humor and results in a drop in intraocular pressure, a reaction considered desirable in case of glaucoma. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the central nervous system appears to retard abnormal paroxysmal and excessive discharge from central nervous system neurons. So, Acetazolamide is also used as an adjuvant in the treatment of epilepsy.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adults
 : Initially 250 mg (1 tablet) 4 times daily. Dose should be adjusted later with individual need. 
Children
 : ½ to 2 tablets in divided doses. 
In intraocular pressure
: 1 tablet 6 hourly. In acute condition, dose should be started with 2 tablets followed by 1 tablet 6 hourly or as directed by the physician

Contraindications





                            Acetazolamide is contraindicated in cases of marked kidney and liver diseases or dysfunction, in situations in which sodium and or potassium blood serum levels decreased. Acetazolamide is also contraindicated in patients with chronic noncongestive angle closure glaucoma
                    










Side Effects





                            Common side effects are headache, drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, anorexia, polyurea, insomnia, gastrointestinal upset.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women and neonates. So, Acetazolamide should be used with care in those physiological conditions.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Keep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.

Pharmacology





                            Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat

Interaction





                            Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Acep. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Acep overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Acep levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of Acep are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care is advised in the administration of Acep to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Acep-containing products concurrently. Acep should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of Acep in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Acep. Use caution when administering Acep in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Acep IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Acep IV in patients with Acep allergy.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of Acep IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Acep IV in adults.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
: Acep is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Acep may be warranted.
Patients with Renal Impairment
: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Acep may be warranted.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Acep. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Acep may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms
: Symptoms of Acep overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Acep overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Acep concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Acep. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.

Interaction





                            Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Acep. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Acep overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Acep levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of Acep are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care is advised in the administration of Acep to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Acep-containing products concurrently. Acep should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of Acep in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Acep. Use caution when administering Acep in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Acep IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Acep IV in patients with Acep allergy.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of Acep IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Acep IV in adults.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
: Acep is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Acep may be warranted.
Patients with Renal Impairment
: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Acep may be warranted.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Acep. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Acep may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms
: Symptoms of Acep overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Acep overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Acep concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Acep. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.

Pharmacology





                            Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat

Interaction





                            Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Acep. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Acep overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Acep levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of Acep are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care is advised in the administration of Acep to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Acep-containing products concurrently. Acep should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of Acep in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Acep. Use caution when administering Acep in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Acep IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Acep IV in patients with Acep allergy.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of Acep IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Acep IV in adults.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
: Acep is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Acep may be warranted.
Patients with Renal Impairment
: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Acep may be warranted.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Acep. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Acep may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms
: Symptoms of Acep overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Acep overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Acep concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Acep. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.

Pharmacology





                            This is a combination of Paracetamol and Caffeine. Paracetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Caffeine is an alkaloid which is a theophylline-like xanthine derivative. By intermolecular association with Paracetamol, Caffeine increases the solubility and transmembrane permeation of Paracetamol. In addition, Caffeine increases the pain threshold and tolerance of pain. Caffeine has also an intrinsic power to raise vessel tone in the brain, which provides another benefit to treat migraine and headache.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adult dose
: 1-2 tablets every 4-6 hours. Maximum dose: 8 tablets daily. 
Child dose
: Not recommended for children below 12 years.

Pharmacology





                            Lisinopril competitively inhibits ACE from converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II (a potent vasoconstrictor) resulting in increased plasma renin activity and reduced aldosterone (a hormone that causes water and Na retention) secretion. This promotes vasodilation and BP reduction.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            Treatment should be started with 2.5 mg once daily. In patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension, not on diuretic therapy, the recommended initial dose is 10 mg once daily. Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. The usual dosage range is 10-20 mg once daily. Maximum dose is 40 mg per day as a single dose or as directed by the physician.
Diuretic treated patients
: In hypertensive patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension may occur, occasionally following the initial dose of Lisinopril. If the diuretic can not be discontinued, and initial dose of 10 mg should be used under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilised for at least an additional hour.

Interaction





                            May enhance hypotensive effect with diuretics. May increase risk of renal function deterioration and decrease antihypertensive effect with NSAIDs. May increase serum levels and toxicity of lithium. Increased risk of hyperkalaemia with K-sparing diuretics and K supplements. May increase nitritoid reactions of gold Na thiomalate.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Lisinopril is contra-indicated in patients who are hypersensitive to this product, in patients with a history of angioneurotic oedema related to previous treatment with an ACE inhibitor. Lisinopril is also contra-indicated in pregnant woman.
                    










Side Effects





                            Chest discomfort, flushing, hypotension, tachycardia, abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, flatulence, joint pain, depression, insomnia, bronchitis, cough may occur.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy Category C by FDA.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Evaluation of the patient should include assessment of renal function prior to initiation of therapy and during
treatment. Acepril should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency, as they may require reduced doses.
Severe hypotension has been reported with ACE inhibitors, mainly in patients with severe heart failure and also in patients with surgery.
Acepril should not be used in patients with aortic stenosis, corpulmonale or outflow tract obstruction.
As it is not known whether Acepril is excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised if Acepril is given to nursing mothers.

Pharmacology





                            Ranitidine competitively blocks histamine at H2-receptors of the gastric parietal cells which inhibits gastric acid secretion. It does not affect pepsin secretion, pentagastrin-stimulated intrinsic factor secretion or serum gastrin.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Ranitidine Tablet & Syrup:


Duodenal and gastric ulcer
: The usual dosage is 150 mg twice daily taken in the morning and evening or 300 mg as a single daily dose at night for 4 to 8 weeks.
Reflux oesophagitis
: 150 mg twice daily or 300 mg at bed time for up to 8 weeks.
Zollinger Ellison syndrome
: 150 mg 3 times daily and increased if necessary up to 6 g daily in divided doses. Dosage should be continued as long as clinically indicated.
Episodic dyspepsia
: 150 mg twice daily or 300 mg at bed time for up to 6 weeks.
Maintenance
: 150 mg at night for preventing recurrences.
Child (peptic ulcer)
: 2-4 mg/kg twice daily, maximum 300 mg daily.


Ranitidine IV injection & IV Infusion:

Ranitidine injection may be given either as a slow (over a period of at least two minutes) intravenous injection of 50 mg, after dilution to a volume of 20 ml per 50 mg dose, which may be repeated every six to eight hours; or as an intermittent intravenous infusion at a rate of 25 mg per hour for two hours; the infusion may be repeated at six to eight hour intervals; or as an intramuscular injection of 50 mg (2 ml) every six to eight hours. In the prophylaxis of haemorrhage from stress ulceration in seriously ill patients or the prophylaxis of recurrent haemorrhage in patients bleeding from peptic ulceration, parenteral administration may be continued until oral feeding commences.
In the prophylaxis of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage from stress ulceration in seriously ill patient sapriming dose of 50 mg as low as intravenous injection followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of 0.125-0.250 mg/kg/hour may be preferred. In patients considered to be at risk of developing aspiration syndrome Ranitidine injection 50 mg may be given intramuscularly or by slow intravenous injection 45 to 60 minutes before induction of general anaesthesia.
Children
: The recommended oral dose for the treatment of peptic ulcer in children is 2 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg twice daily to a maximum of 300 mg ranitidine per day. Safety and effectiveness of Ranitidine injection have not been established in case of children.

Interaction





                            Delayed absorption and increased peak serum concentration with propantheline bromide. Aceptin-R minimally inhibits hepatic metabolism of coumarin anticoagulants, theophylline, diazepam and propanolol. May alter absorption of pH-dependent drugs (e.g. ketoconazole, midazolam, glipizide). May reduce bioavailability with antacids.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Patients hypersensitive to Ranitidine
                    










Side Effects





                            Aceptin-R is well tolerated and side effects are usually uncommon. Altered bowel habit, dizziness, rash, tiredness, reversible confusional states, headache, decreased blood counts, muscle or joint pain have rarely been reported.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation






Pregnancy
: Ranitidine crosses the placenta. But there is no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the foetus due to Ranitidine. Like other drugs, Ranitidine should only be used during pregnancy if considered essential.
Lactation
: Ranitidine is excreted in human breast milk. Caution should be exercised when the drug is administered to a nursing mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Aceptin-R should be given in reduced dosage to patients with impaired renal and hepatic function.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Use in elderly patients
: In clinical trial the ulcer healing rates have been found similar in patients age 65 and over with those in younger patients. Additionally, there was no difference in the incidence of adverse effects.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Aceptin-R is very specific in action and accordingly no particular problems are expected following overdosage with the drug. Symptomatic and supportive therapy should be given as appropriate. If required, the drug may be removed from the plasma by haemodiaiysis.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            H2 receptor antagonist
                    








Reconstitution

Pharmacology





                            Ramipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which after hydrolysis to ramiprilat, blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. So, inhibition of ACE by ramipril results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Thus ramipril exerts its antihypertensive activity. It is also effective in the management of heart failure and reduction of the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular events. It is long acting and well tolerated; so, can be used in long term therapy.
                    
























Dosage





                            Dosage of Ramipril must be adjusted according to the patient tolerance and response.
Hypertension
: For the management of hypertension in adults not receiving a diuretic, the usual initial dose of Ramipril is 1.25-2.5 mg once daily. Dosage generally is adjusted no more rapidly than at 2 week intervals. The usual maintenance dosage in adults is 2.5-20 mg daily given as a single dose or in 2 divided doses daily. If BP is not controlled with Ramipril alone, a diuretic may be added.
Congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction
: In this case, Ramipril therapy may be initiated as early as 2 days after myocardial infarction. An initial dose of 2.5 mg twice daily is recommended, but if hypotension occurs, dose should be reduced to 1.25 mg twice daily. Therapy is then titrated to a target daily dose of 5 mg twice daily. 
Prevention of major cardiovascular events
: In this case, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg once daily for the first week of therapy and 5 mg once daily for the following 3 weeks; dosage then may be increased, as tolerated, to a maintenance dosage of 10 mg once daily.
Dosage in renal impairment
: 




For patients with hypertension and renal impairment
: The recommended initial dose is 1.25 mg Ramipril once daily. Subsequent dosage should be titrated according to individual tolerance and BP response, up to a maximum of 5 mg daily.


For patients with heart failure and renal impairment
: The recommended dose is 1.25 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to 1.25 mg twice daily and up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg twice daily depending upon clinical response and tolerability.

Administration





                            Ramipril tablets have to be swallowed with sufficient amounts of liquid. The tablets must not be chewed or crushed. Absorption of Ramipril is not significantly affected by food. Ramipril may, therefore, be taken before, during or after a meal.

Interaction





                            Concomitant administration with diuretics may lead to serious hypotension and in addition dangerous hyperkalemia with potassium sparing diuretics. Concomitant therapy with lithium may increase the serum lithium concentration. Reduction in BP may affect the ability to drive and operate machinery and this may be exacerbated by alcohol. NSAIDs may reduce the antihypertensive effect of Aceril and cause deterioration of renal function.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Ramipril must not be used




in patients with hypersensitivity to ramipril, to any other ACE inhibitor, or any of the excipients of Ramipril.


in patients with a history of angioedema.


concomitantly with sacubitril/valsartan therapy. Do not initiate Ramipril until sacubitril/valsartan is eliminated from the body. In case of switch from Ramipril to sacubitril/valsartan, do not start sacubitril/valsartan until Ramipril is eliminated from the body.


in patients with haemodynamically relevant renal artery stenosis, bilateral or unilateral in the single kidney.


in patients with hypotensive or haemodynamically unstable states.


with aliskiren-containing medicines in patients with diabetes or with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 ml/min).


with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) in patients with diabetic nephropathy.


during pregnancy.



Concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and extracorporeal treatments leading to contact of blood with negatively charged surfaces must be avoided, since such use may lead to severe anaphylactoid reactions. Such extracorporeal treatments include dialysis or haemofiltration with certain high-fux (e.g. polyacrylonitril) membranes and low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate.
                    










Side Effects





                            Aceril is generally well tolerated. Dizziness, headache, fatigue and asthenia are commonly reported side effects. Other side effects occurring less frequently include symptomatic hypotension, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, urticaria, oliguria, anxiety, amnesia etc. Angioneurotic oedema, anaphylactic reactions and hyperkalaemia have also been reported rarely.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Ramipril must not be taken during pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy must be excluded before starting treatment. Pregnancy must be avoided in cases where treatment with ACE inhibitors is indispensable. If the patient intends to become pregnant, treatment with ACE inhibitors must be discontinued, i.e. replaced by another form of treatment. If the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, medication with Ramipril must be replaced as soon as possible by a treatment regimen without ACE inhibitors. Otherwise, there is a risk of harm to the fetus. Ramipril is not recommended during breastfeeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Aceril should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, and impaired hepatic function.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Elderly
: A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Aceril daily must be considered.
Hepatic impairment
: Treatment in these patients must therefore be initiated only under close medical supervision. The maximum permitted daily dose in such cases is 2.5 mg Aceril.
Renal impairment
: With a creatinine clearance between 50 and 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area, the initial daily dose is generally 1.25 mg Aceril. The maximum permitted daily dose, in this case, is 5 mg Aceril. Patients with incompletely corrected fuid or salt depletion, in patients with severe hypertension, as well as in patients in whom a hypotensive reaction would constitute a particular risk, (e.g., with relevant stenoses of the coronary vessels or those supplying the brain) A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Aceril daily must be considered.
Patients pretreated with a diuretic
: Consideration must be given to discontinuing the diuretic for at least 2 to 3 days or- depending on the duration of action of the diuretic- longer before starting treatment with Aceril, or at least to reducing the diuretic dose. The initial daily dose in patients previously treated with a diuretic is generally 1.25 mg Aceril.
                    








Overdose Effects






Sign and symptom
: Overdosage may cause excessive peripheral vasodilatation (with marked hypotension, shock), bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances, and renal failure.
Management
: Primary detoxifcation by, for example, gastric lavage, administration of adsorbents, sodium sulfate; (if possible during the frst 30 minutes). In the event of hypotension administration of α1-adrenergic agonists (e.g. norepinephrine, dopamine) or angiotensin II (angiotensinamide), which is usually available only in scattered research laboratories, must be considered in addition to volume and salt substitution.

Pharmacology





                            Acyclovir exerts its antiviral e­ects on Herpes simplex virus and Varicella zoster virus by interfering with DNA synthesis and inhibiting viral replication. In cells infected with Herpes virus, the antiviral activity of Acyclovir appears to depend principally on the intracellular conversion of the drug to Acyclovir Triphosphate. Acyclovir is converted to Acyclovir Monophosphate principally via virus coded thymidine kinase, the monophosphate is phosphorylated to diphosphate via cellular guanylate kinase and then via other cellular enzymes to the Triphosphate, which is the pharmacologically active form of the drug.
                    
























Dosage








Herpes simplex infection: For normal or immunocompromised immune status: 5 mg/kg every 8 hours


Very severe Herpes zoster infection (shingles): For normal immune status: 5 mg/kg every 8 hours


Varicella zoster infection: For immunocompromised immune status: 10 mg/kg every 8 hours


Herpes simplex encephalitis: For normal or immunocompromised immune status: 10 mg/kg every 8 hours



Each dose should be administered by slow intravenous infusion over a one-hour period.

Administration





                            It is recommended that Acyclovir IV Injection for Intravenous Infusion should be administered for five to seven days in the treatment of most infections and for at least ten days in the treatment of Herpes simplex encephalitis.
Acyclovir IV Injection after reconstitution may be injected directly into a vein over one hour by a controlled-rate infusion pump or be further diluted for administration by infusion. For intravenous infusion each vial of Acyclovir IV Injection should be reconstituted and then, wholly or in part according to the dosage required, added to and mixed with at least 50 mL-100 ml infusion solution. A maximum of 250 mg & 500 mg of Acyclovir may be added to 50 ml & 100 ml infusion solution respectively. After addition of Acyclovir IV Injection to an infusion solution the mixture should be shaken to ensure thorough mixing. Acyclovir IV Injection when diluted in accordance with the above schedule will give an Acyclovir concentration not greater than 0.5% w/v.
Acyclovir IV Injection is known to be compatible with the following infusion fluids and stable for up to 12 hours at room temperature (below 25°C) when diluted to a concentration not greater than 0.5% w/v Acyclovir.




Sodium Chloride Intravenous Infusion BP (0.45% and 0.9% w/v)


Sodium Chloride (0.18% w/v) and Glucose (4% w/v) Intravenous Infusion


Sodium Chloride (0.45% w/v) and Glucose (2.5% w/v) Intravenous Infusion


Compound Sodium Lactate Intravenous Infusion BP (Hartmann's Solution)



Acyclovir IV Injection for Intravenous Infusion contains no preservative. Reconstitution and dilution should therefore be carried out immediately before use and any unused solution should be discarded. The solution should not be refrigerated.

Interaction





                            Co-administration of probenecid with Acerux has been shown to increase the mean Acerux half-life and the area under the concentration time curve. Urinary excretion and renal clearance correspondingly reduced. In patients over 60 years of age concurrent use of diuretics increases plasma levels of Acerux very significantly.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Acyclovir IV Injection is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to Acyclovir or Valacyclovir.
                    










Side Effects





                            Some infrequent adverse reactions are lethargy, obtundation, tremors, confusion, hallucinations, agitation, somnolence, psychosis, convulsions and coma, phlebitis, nausea, vomiting, reversible increases in liver-related enzymes, pruritus, urticaria, rashes, increases in blood urea and creatinine. Local inflammatory reactions may occur if Acerux IV Infusion is inadvertently infused into extracellular tissues.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy category B. There have been no adequate and well controlled studies concerning the safety of Acyclovir in pregnant women. It should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefits to the patient clearly outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. Acyclovir should only be administered to nursing mothers if the benefits to the mother outweigh the potential risks to the baby. There is no experience of the effect of Acyclovir on human fertility.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Acerux IV injection is intended for intravenous infusion only and should not be used through any other route. Reconstituted Acerux IV Infusion has a pH of approximately 11.0 and should not be administered by mouth. Acerux IV injection as infusion must be given over a period of at least one hour in order to avoid renal tubular damage. It should not be administered as a bolus injection. Acerux IV infusion must be accompanied by adequate hydration. Since maximum urine concentration occurs within the first few hours following infusion, particular attention should be given to establish sufficient urine ‑ow during that period. Concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs, pre-existing renal disease and dehydration increase the risk of further renal impairment by Acerux. As Acerux has been associated with reversible encephalopathic changes, it should be used with caution in patients with neurological abnormalities, significant hypoxia or serious renal, hepatic or electrolyte abnormalities.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric use
: The dose of Acerux IV injection in children aged 1-12 years should be calculated on the basis of body surface area. Children in this age group with Herpes simplex infections (except Herpes simplex encephalitis) or Varicella zoster infections should be given Acerux IV Infusion in doses of 250 mg/m
2
 (equivalent to 5 mg/kg in adults). Immunocompromised children in this age group with Varicella zoster virus infection or with Herpes simplex encephalitis should be given Acerux IV Infusion in doses of 500 mg/m
2
 (equivalent to 10 mg/kg in adults). Children with impaired renal function require an appropriately modified dose, according to the degree of impairment.
 
Geriatric use
: No data are available on this age group. However, as creatinine clearance is often low in the elderly, special attention should be given to dosage reduction.
In patients with renal impairment
: Acerux should be administered with caution since the drug is excreted through the kidneys. The following modifications in dosage are suggested:




CrCl: 25-50 ml/min: 5 or 10 mg/kg every 12 hours


CrCl: 10-25 ml/min: 5 or 10 mg/kg every 24 hours


CrCl: 0-10 ml/min: 2.5 or 5 mg/kg every 24 hours and after dialysis.












Overdose Effects





                            Overdosage of intravenous Acerux has resulted in elevations of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and subsequent renal failure. Neurological effects including confusion, hallucinations, agitation, seizures and coma have been described in association with over dosage. Adequate hydration is essential to reduce the possibility of crystal formation in the urine. Hemodialysis significantly enhances the removal of Acerux from the blood and may, therefore, be considered an option in the management of overdose of Acerux.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Herpes simplex & Varicella-zoster virus infections
                    








Duration of Treatment





                            It is recommended that Acerux IV Injection for Intravenous Infusion should be administered for five to seven days in the treatment of most infections and for at least ten days in the treatment of Herpes simplex encephalitis.
                    








Reconstitution





                            Each 250 mg vial of Acerux IV Injection should be reconstituted by the addition of 10 ml of either Water for Injection or Sodium Chloride Intravenous Infusion (0.9% w/v). This provides a solution containing 25 mg Acerux per ml.
Each 500 mg vial of Acerux IV Injection should be reconstituted by the addition of 10 ml of either Water for Injection or Sodium Chloride Intravenous Infusion (0.9% w/v). This provides a solution containing 50 mg Acerux per ml.
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Store at 15°C to 25°C. Protected from light and moisture. Keep the medicine out of the reach of children.

Indications





                            Aciclovir is indicated for-




The treatment of viral infections due to Herpes simplex virus (type I & II) and Varicella zoster virus (herpes zoster & chicken pox).


The treatment of Herpes simplex virus infections of the skin and mucous membranes including initial and recurrent genital herpes and herpes labialis.


The prophylaxis of Herpes simplex infections in immunocompromised patients

Pharmacology





                            Aciclovir is a synthetic purine derivative. Aciclovir exerts its antiviral effect on Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Varicella-zoster virus by interfering with DNA synthesis and inhibiting viral replication. In cells infected with herpes virus, the antiviral activity of Aciclovir appears to depend principally on the intracellular conversion of the drug to Aciclovir Triphosphate. Aciclovir is converted to Aciclovir Monophosphate principally via virus coded thymidine kinase; the monophosphate is phosphorylated to the diphosphate via cellular guanylate kinase and then via another cellular enzyme to the triphosphate, which is the pharmacologically active form of the drug. 15-30% of an oral dose of the drug is absorbed from Gl tract. Peak plasma concentrations usually occur within 1.5-2 hours after oral administration. It is widely distributed into body tissues and fluids including the brain, saliva, lungs, liver, muscle, spleen, uterus, vaginal mucosa and secretions, CSF, and herpetic vesicular fluid.

Indications





                            Aciclovir is indicated for-




The treatment of viral infections due to Herpes simplex virus (type I & II) and Varicella zoster virus (herpes zoster & chicken pox).


The treatment of Herpes simplex virus infections of the skin and mucous membranes including initial and recurrent genital herpes and herpes labialis.


The prophylaxis of Herpes simplex infections in immunocompromised patients

Pharmacology





                            Aciclovir is a synthetic purine derivative. Aciclovir exerts its antiviral effect on Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Varicella-zoster virus by interfering with DNA synthesis and inhibiting viral replication. In cells infected with herpes virus, the antiviral activity of Aciclovir appears to depend principally on the intracellular conversion of the drug to Aciclovir Triphosphate. Aciclovir is converted to Aciclovir Monophosphate principally via virus coded thymidine kinase; the monophosphate is phosphorylated to the diphosphate via cellular guanylate kinase and then via another cellular enzyme to the triphosphate, which is the pharmacologically active form of the drug. 15-30% of an oral dose of the drug is absorbed from Gl tract. Peak plasma concentrations usually occur within 1.5-2 hours after oral administration. It is widely distributed into body tissues and fluids including the brain, saliva, lungs, liver, muscle, spleen, uterus, vaginal mucosa and secretions, CSF, and herpetic vesicular fluid. Aciclovir is excreted through the kidney by the glomerular filtration & tubular secretion.

Pharmacology





                            Acyclovir is an antiviral agent which is highly active in vitro against Herpes simplex (HSV) types I and II and Varicella zoster viruses, but its toxicity to mammalian cells is low. Acyclovir is phosphorylated to the active compound Acyclovir triphosphate after entry into herpes infected cell. The ­first step in this process requires the presence of the viral-coded thymidine kinase. Acyclovir triphosphate acts as an inhibitor of and substrate for the herpes specifi­ed DNA polymerase preventing further viral DNA synthesis without affecting normal cellular processes.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            The dosage for all age groups is the same. A 10 mm ribbon of the ointment should be placed inside the lower conjunctival sac ­five times a day at approximately four hourly intervals. Treatment should continue for at least 3 days after healing

Interaction





                            No clinically signi­ficant interactions have been identi­fied.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Acyclovir is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to Acyclovir or Valacyclovir
                    










Side Effects





                            Very common: Superfi­cial punctate keratopathy. This did not necessitate an early termination of therapy and healed without apparent sequelae. Common: Transient mild stinging of the eye occurring immediately following application, conjunctivitis. Rare: Blepharitis.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy category B. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Acyclovir in pregnant women. It is not known whether topically applied Acyclovir is excreted in breast milk.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            The recommended dosage, frequency of applications, and length of treatment should not be exceeded.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            No adverse effects would be expected if the entire contents of the tube containing 90 mg Acerux were ingested orally.

Pharmacology





                            Acyclovir is a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue with inhibitory activity against Herpes simplex viruses type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) in cell culture and in vivo. The inhibitory activity of Acyclovir is highly selective due to its affinity for the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by HSV. This viral enzyme converts Acyclovir into Acyclovir monophosphate, a nucleotide analogue. The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes. In cell culture, Acyclovir Triphosphate stops replication of herpes viral DNA. This inhibition is accomplished in 3 ways: 




Competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase


Incorporation into and termination of the growing viral DNA chain


Inactivation of the viral DNA polymerase



Hydrocortisone is the main glucocorticoid secreted by the adrenal cortex. It is used topically for its anti-inflammatory effects which suppress the clinical manifestations of the disease in a wide range of disorders where inflammation is a prominent feature.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            The cream should be topically applied 5 times per day for 5 days. Therapy should be initiated as early as possible after the first signs and symptoms.

Composition





                            Each tablet contains:




Vitamin A: 2000 IU


Vitamin C: 200 mg


Vitamin E: 50 IU


Vitamin K: 75 mcg


Zinc: 15 mg

Pharmacology






Vitamin A
 is essential for human health. Vitamin A is highly important for vision, cell development and immunity. Vitamin A's role on immunity contributes to its anti-cancer properties.
Vitamin C
 is one of the most widely taken supplements and plays a primary role in the formation of collagen, which is important for the growth and repair of cells, gums, blood vessels, bones and teeth. Thus vitamin C helps in faster recovery after surgery or any other trauma. Vitamin C quenches free radicals in the water based cellular components and thus acts as an antioxidant.
Vitamin E
 is a fat-soluble vitamin, which is stored in the liver, adipose tissues, heart, muscles etc. It is an active antioxidant, which prevents oxidation of fat compounds. It works in synergy with Selenium.
Vitamin K
 is a key anti-aging vitamin and it prevents heart disease and osteoporosis.
Zinc
 is an important mineral that can actually rejuvenate the shrinking thymus gland that involves the working of the immune system. Zinc is a co-factor in over 100 enzymes of the body.
Selenium:
 Apart from being a co-factor in antioxidant enzymes, Selenium by itself has potent antioxidant capabilities. So, it prevents aging and hardening of tissues through oxidation. Vitamin E and Selenium are synergistic and seem to potentiate each other's antioxidant activities.
Copper
 is an important co-factor of a number of enzymes present in our body. This enzymes act as endogenous antioxidant systems.
Manganese
, an antioxidant, is one of the minerals required to form SOD (Super Oxide Dismutase). SOD is an enzyme that protect against cell damaging free radicals.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            The adult dose is 1 (one) tablet daily, or as prescribed by the physician.

Pharmacology





                            Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat

Interaction





                            Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Aceta. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Aceta overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Aceta levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of Aceta are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care is advised in the administration of Aceta to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Aceta-containing products concurrently. Aceta should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of Aceta in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Aceta. Use caution when administering Aceta in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Aceta IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Aceta IV in patients with Aceta allergy.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of Aceta IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Aceta IV in adults.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
: Aceta is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Aceta may be warranted.
Patients with Renal Impairment
: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Aceta may be warranted.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Aceta. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Aceta may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms
: Symptoms of Aceta overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Aceta overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Aceta concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Aceta. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.

Pharmacology





                            Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat

Interaction





                            Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Aceta. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Aceta overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Aceta levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of Aceta are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care is advised in the administration of Aceta to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Aceta-containing products concurrently. Aceta should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of Aceta in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Aceta. Use caution when administering Aceta in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Aceta IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Aceta IV in patients with Aceta allergy.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of Aceta IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Aceta IV in adults.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
: Aceta is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Aceta may be warranted.
Patients with Renal Impairment
: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Aceta may be warranted.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Aceta. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Aceta may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms
: Symptoms of Aceta overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Aceta overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Aceta concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Aceta. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.

Interaction





                            Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Aceta Extend. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Aceta Extend overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Aceta Extend levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of Aceta Extend are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care is advised in the administration of Aceta Extend to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Aceta Extend-containing products concurrently. Aceta Extend should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of Aceta Extend in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Aceta Extend. Use caution when administering Aceta Extend in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Aceta Extend IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Aceta Extend IV in patients with Aceta Extend allergy.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of Aceta Extend IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Aceta Extend IV in adults.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
: Aceta Extend is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Aceta Extend may be warranted.
Patients with Renal Impairment
: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Aceta Extend may be warranted.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Aceta Extend. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Aceta Extend may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms
: Symptoms of Aceta Extend overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Aceta Extend overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Aceta Extend concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Aceta Extend. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.

Pharmacology





                            Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat

Pharmacology





                            Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat

Interaction





                            Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Aceta-PD. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Aceta-PD overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Aceta-PD levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of Aceta-PD are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care is advised in the administration of Aceta-PD to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Aceta-PD-containing products concurrently. Aceta-PD should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of Aceta-PD in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Aceta-PD. Use caution when administering Aceta-PD in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Aceta-PD IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Aceta-PD IV in patients with Aceta-PD allergy.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of Aceta-PD IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Aceta-PD IV in adults.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
: Aceta-PD is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Aceta-PD may be warranted.
Patients with Renal Impairment
: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Aceta-PD may be warranted.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Aceta-PD. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Aceta-PD may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms
: Symptoms of Aceta-PD overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Aceta-PD overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Aceta-PD concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Aceta-PD. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.

Pharmacology





                            Paracetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin.
Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, from animal tests, at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable: binding of parent and M
1
 metabolite to μ-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Opioid activity is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O-demethylated metabolite M
1
 to μ-opioid receptors. Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro, as have some other opioid analgesics.These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






For the management of moderate to moderately severe pain
: The recommended dose is 1 or 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain relief up to a maximum of 8 tablets per day.
In case of short-term (five days or less) management of acute pain
: The recommended dose is 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain relief up to a maximum of 8 tablets per day.
This tablet can be administered without regard to food.

Pharmacology





                            This is a combination of Paracetamol and Caffeine. Paracetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Caffeine is an alkaloid which is a theophylline-like xanthine derivative. By intermolecular association with Paracetamol, Caffeine increases the solubility and transmembrane permeation of Paracetamol. In addition, Caffeine increases the pain threshold and tolerance of pain. Caffeine has also an intrinsic power to raise vessel tone in the brain, which provides another benefit to treat migraine and headache.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adult dose
: 1-2 tablets every 4-6 hours. Maximum dose: 8 tablets daily. 
Child dose
: Not recommended for children below 12 years.

Pharmacology






Acetylcysteine is a mucolytic agent that reduces the viscosity of secretions probably by the splitting of disulphide bonds in mucoproteins. Moreover it gives antisecretory effect. These results in clearing of respiratory ducts and facilitate breathing. Acetylcysteine also has anti-oxidant properties by reacting with free radicals and also by serving as a precursor to glutathione, which is an important intra and extra-cellular antioxidant. By providing anti-oxidant action, it neutralizes exogenous and endogenous oxidants, which in fact act as pathogens in respiratory inflammations.


























Dosage & Administration






Effervescent tablet or Dispersible tablet
: Adults and children above 6 years: One effervescent tablet of Acetylcysteine 600 mg a day (preferably in the evening). The duration of treatment should be 5 to 10 days in the acute treatment, whereas it may be continued in the chronic states for several months, according to the advice of the physician. Dissolve the tablets in a glass containing a small quantity of water, mixing it, if necessary, with a spoon. A palatable solution is thus obtained, which can be drunk directly from the glass.
Effervescent Granules
:




Adults and children above 6 years: 1 sachet Acetylcysteine 200 mg or 2 sachets Acetylcysteine 100 mg, 2-3 times a day.


Children (2-6 years of age): 1 sachet Acetylcysteine 100 mg from 2 to 4 times a day, according to the age.



The duration of treatment should be 5 to 10 days in the acute treatment, whereas it may be continued in the chronic states for several months, according to the advice of the physician.
Dissolve the contents of the sachets in a glass containing a small quantity of water; mixing it, if necessary, with a spoon. A palatable solution is thus obtained, which can be drunk directly from the glass.
Nebuliser Solution
: The 20% solution may be diluted to a lesser concentration with either Sodium Chloride for injection, Sodium Chloride for inhalation, sterile water for injection, or sterile water for inhalation.




Adult: 5-10 ml of 10% or 20% solution by Nebuliser every 6-8 hr PRN.


Children: 1-11 months: 1-2 ml of 20% or 2-4 ml of 10% solution by Nebuliser every 6-8 hr PRN.


12 months-11 years: 3-5 ml of 20% or 6-10 ml of 10% solution by Nebuliser every 6-8 hr PRN.


Below 12 years: 5-10 ml of 10/20% solution by Nebuliser every 6-8 hr PRN.




** Diagnostic Bronchograms
: 1-2 ml of 20% or 2-4 ml of 10% solution 2-3 times by Nebulisation or by instillation intratracheally prior to procedure.
** Nebulisation tent or croupette
: This form of administration requires very large volumes of the solution, occasionally as much as 300 ml during a single treatment period. If a tent or croupette must be used, the recommended dose is the volume of acetylcysteine (using 20%) that will maintain a very heavy mist in the tent or croupette for the desired period. Administration for intermittent or continuous prolonged periods, including overnight, may be desirable.
** Direct Instillation
: When used by direct instillation, 1-2 ml of a 20% solution may be given as often as every hour. When used for the routine nursing care of patients with tracheostomy, 1-2 ml of a 20% solution may be given every 1-4 hours by instillation into the tracheostomy.

Interaction





                            The thiol group of Aceten can reduce the efficacy of certain antibiotics such as ampicillin, tetracycline, macrolides, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and amphotericin. Concomitant use of Aceten and amoxicillin will increase the level of the antibiotic in tissues. It is, therefore, advisable to use the two medicines 2 hours apart from each other. Aceten can increase the inhibitory effect of thrombocyte aggregation and vasodialation by nitroglycerine.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Known hypersensitivity to Acetylcysteine. Acetylcysteine contains aspartame, thus it is contraindicated in patients suffering from phenylketonuria.
                    










Side Effects





                            Like all medicines, Aceten can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. In very rare cases, severe immune reactions may occur such as anaphylactic shock and severe skin reaction. In rare cases the oral administration can be followed by shortness of breath, upset stomach and bronchospasm. The most frequent side effects are headache, increased heart rate, stomatitis, pruritus, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, decrease in the blood pressure, diarrhoea and noises in the ears.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            In case of pregnancy & lactation the medicine should be taken consulting physician or pharmacist.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Patients suffering from bronchial asthma must be strictly controlled during the therapy; should bronchospasm occur, the treatment must immediately be suspended. Caution should be taken in patients suffering from or with a history of peptic ulcer. As Viscotin contains sodium (156.9mg per dose) this has to be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. The possible presence of a sulphureous odor does not indicate an alteration of the product but is a characteristic of the active ingredient contained in Aceten. It is preferable not to mix other drugs with the Viscotin solution.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Overdose of Aceten may cause nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Antidote preparations, Cough expectorants & mucolytics
                    








Storage Conditions

                            Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat

Interaction





                            Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Aceto. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Aceto overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Aceto levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of Aceto are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care is advised in the administration of Aceto to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Aceto-containing products concurrently. Aceto should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of Aceto in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Aceto. Use caution when administering Aceto in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Aceto IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Aceto IV in patients with Aceto allergy.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of Aceto IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Aceto IV in adults.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
: Aceto is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Aceto may be warranted.
Patients with Renal Impairment
: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Aceto may be warranted.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Aceto. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Aceto may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms
: Symptoms of Aceto overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Aceto overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Aceto concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Aceto. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.

Pharmacology





                            Captopril is a sulfhydryl-containing analog of proline with antihypertensive activity. Captopril competitively inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), thereby decreasing levels of angiotensin II, increasing plasma renin activity, and decreasing aldosterone secretion. Approxiately 60-75% of an oral dose of captopril is repidly absorbed from the GI tract in fasting healthy individuals or hypertensive patients. More than 95% of a dose is excreted renally, both as unchanged (45-50%) drug and as metabolites.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            Adults: 
Mild-to-moderate hypertension
: The initial dose is 12.5 mg twice daily. The usual maintenance dose is 25mg twice daily which can be increased incrementally, at two to four week intervals, until a satisfactory response is achieved, to a maximum of 50 mg twice daily.
Severe hypertension
: In severe hypertension the starting dose is 12.5 mg b.d. The dosage may be increased incrementally to a maximum of 50 mg t.d.s.
Heart failure
: A starting dose of 6.25mg or 12.5mg may minimise a transient hypotensive effect. The usual maintenance dose is 25mg three times a day. The usual maximum dose is 150 mg daily.
Captopril must be taken 1 hour before meals to ensure maximum absorption.
Use in Child
: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

Pharmacology





                            Tolfenamic acid (N-(2-methyl-3-chlorophenyl) anthranilic acid) belongs to the fenamate group and is a potent inhibitor of cyclooxygenase enzyme, thus it inhibits the synthesis of important inflammatory mediators such as thromboxane (TX) B2 and prostaglandin (PG) E2. Prostaglandins are responsible for causing swelling pain and inflammation associated with these conditions. It acts not only by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, but it also has direct antagonistic action on its receptors.
Pharmacokinetic properties: Absorption Readily absorbed from GI tract. Peak plasma concentration: 60-90 min. Bioavailability 85%. Distribution: Protein-binding: 99% Plasma half-life 2 hours. Metabolism: Metabolised in the liver. Tolfenamic acid undergoes enterohepatic circulation. Excretion: Excreted in urine (90%) and faces.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            Adult:




Acute migraine attacks

Interaction





                            The rate of absorption of Achnil increases with Metoclopramide and Magnesium hydroxide but decreases with Aluminium hydroxide. Risk of bleeding with anticoagulants and other NSAIDS increases when use with Achnil. It decreases antihypertensive response to loop diuretics, B-blockers and ACE Inhibitors. Co-administration increases plasma concentration of Lithium Methotrexate and cardiac glycosides. It also increases the risk of nephrotoxicity with ACE inhibitors, Ciclosporin, Tacrolimus or diuretics

250 mg or 500 mg tablet
: Acical is used for the treatment or prevention of calcium depletion in patients in whom dietary measures are inadequate. Conditions that may be associated with calcium deficiency include hypoparathyroidism, achlorhydria, chronic diarrhea, vitamin D deficiency, steatorrhea, sprue, pregnancy and lactation, menopause, pancreatitis, renal failure, alkalosis, and hyperphosphataemia. Calcium Carbonate is being used increasingly often to treat hyperphosphataemia in chronic renal failure as well as those on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and haemodialysis. Many patients are unable to tolerate sufficient doses for complete phosphate control and require additional measures such as stringent dietary phosphate restriction or relatively small doses of aluminium hydroxide. Calcium Carbonate containing preparations can provide short-term relief of dyspeptic systems but are no longer recommended for long-term treatment of peptic ulceration.
1000 mg tablet
: Acical is indicated for the management of conditions associated with hyperidity and for fast relief of acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach and upset stomach.

Pharmacology





                            Calcium carbonate reacts with gastric acid to produce a salt and water. For calcium carbonate the postulated chemical reaction is: CaCO
3
+2HCl = CaCl
2
+H
2
O+CO
2
. Two grams of calcium carbonate will readily bring 100 ml of hydrochloric acid to a pH above 6. The increase in gastric pH diminishes the activity of pepsin in the gastric secretion. Up to 30% of the oral calcium load may be absorbed.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






250 mg or 500 mg tablet
: Calcium Carbonate is always used orally and when used as an antacid the recommended doses for adults are equivalent to 540-2000 mg Calcium Carbonate per day, doses for children being half of those for adults. As a dietary supplement, such as for the prevention of osteoporosis, 1250-3750 mg Calcium Carbonate (500-1500 mg calcium) daily is recommended in general, but again this will need to be tailored to the individual patient depending on any specific disease such as Calcium deficiency, malabsorption or parathyroid function. In pregnancy and lactation the recommended daily dose of calcium is 1200-1500 mg. In chronic renal failure the doses used vary from 2.5-9.0 gm Calcium Carbonate per day and need to be adjusted according to the individual patient. To maximize effective phosphate binding in this context the Calcium Carbonate should be given with meals.
1000 mg tablet
: 2000-3000 mg tablet when symptoms occur; may be repeated hourly if needed or as directed by the physician.

Interaction





                            Calcium Carbonate may enhance the cardiac effects of digoxin and other cardiac glycosides, if systemic hypercalcaemia occurs. Calcium Carbonate may interfere with the absorption of concomitantly administered tetracycline preparations and in chronic renal failure modification of vitamin D therapy may be required to avoid hypercalcaemia when Calcium Carbonate is used as the primary phosphate binder.
                    




















Contraindications








Hypercalcaemia and hyperparathyroidism


Hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis


Zollinger-Ellison syndrome


Concomitant digoxin therapy (requires careful monitoring of serum calcium level)



When hypercalcaemia occurs, discontinuation of the drug is usually sufficient to return serum calcium concentrations to normal. Calcium salts should be used cautiously in patients with sarcoidosis, renal or cardiac disease, and in patients receiving cardiac glycosides.
                    










Side Effects





                            Orally administered Calcium Carbonate may be irritating to the GI tract. It may also cause constipation. Hypercalcaemia is rarely produced by administration of calcium alone, but may occur when large doses are given to patients with chronic renal failure.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Calcium containing drugs have been widely used in pregnancy by way of oral calcium supplementation or antacid therapy. Calcium Carbonate can be used in lactating women too.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Use in children
: Calcium carbonate has been extensively studied in children and infants with chronic renal failure and is both safe and effective.
Use in elderly
: In case of elderly patients with renal failure when calcium carbonate is taken constipation may be troublesome one for this group. For this reason, monitoring of serum calcium and phosphate is of course indicated for elderly patients.

Pharmacology





                            Calcium is used as a pharmacologic agent in humans almost entirely to remedy deficiency. Adequate calcium in the blood is so vital to a wide variety of bodily functions that our internal biochemistry will not tolerate a deficiency even for short periods. Vitamin-C is an essential component of the diet as man can not synthesize vitamin-C. It is a very powerful reducing agent. Vitamin-C plays an important part in the response of the body to stress. It is important in the defense against infection.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Children 3 to 7 years
: ½ effervescent tablet daily.
Adults & children above 7 years
: 1 effervescent tablet daily. 
Dissolve 1 tablet in a glass of water before consumption.

Interaction





                            Potentially hazardous interactions:




Digoxin, tetracycline, furosemide, pentagastrin.


Aminophylline, bleomycin, erythromycin, lactobionate, nafcillin, nitrofurantion, conjugated estrogens, salfafurazole, diethanolamine, chloramphenicol.



Potentially useful interactions:




Vitamin-D, oxytocin and prostaglandins


Vitamin-C enhances iron absorption
























Contraindications





                            Hypercalcemia (e.g. in hyperparathyroidism, vitamin-D overdosage, decalcifying tumors such as plasmocytoma, bone metastases); severe hypercalciuria; severe renal failure.
Patients with hyperoxalauria, glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, or iron overload. Larger doses may lead to gastrointestinal tract upset.
                    










Side Effects





                            In rare cases, mild gastrointestinal disturbances (bloating, diarrhea) can occur. In predisposed patients, prolonged treatment with high doses may promote the formation of calculi in the urinary tract.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies with oral calcium have shown no increase in the teratogenic hazard to the fetus. Although supplemental calcium may be excreted in breast milk, the concentration is unlikely to be sufficient to produce any adverse effect on the neonate. Vitamin C may be taken safely during pregnancy and lactation.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            For patients with mild hypercalciuria (exceeding 300 mg = 7.5 mmol/24 hours), with mild or moderate impairment of renal function or with a history of urinary concrements, monitoring of calcium excretion in the urine is required. If necessary, the dosage should be reduced or therapy should be discontinued. High doses of vitamin-D and derivatives should be avoided during treatment with Acical-C unless especially indicated.
Since citrate salts have been reported to increase aluminium absorption, this medicine  should be used with caution in patients with severely impaired renal function, especially those receiving aluminium-containing preparations. The sugar content should be taken into account by diabetic patients.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Acute overdosage has not been reported. It would be expected to cause gastrointestinal disturbances but not to result in hypercalcemia, except in patients treated with a very high dosage of vitamin-D and derivatives.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Specific mineral & vitamin combined preparations
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Store in a cool & dry place. Protect from heat, light and moisture & keep out of reach of children. Keep the tube tightly closed after each use.

Pharmacology





                            Nutrition is the most important to prevent osteoporosis and other bone related diseases. Calcium, Magnesium & Vitamin D3 are the macronutrients for bone. Without Vitamin D3 very little Calcium is absorbed. Like Calcium, Magnesium increases bone strength and rigidity. Recent epidemiological studies showed that some micronutrients like Copper, Manganese, Zinc & Boron play an important role in bone health. Deficiency of the micronutrients is noticed in patients with osteoporosis.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adult
: 1 film-coated tablet twice daily, preferably 1 tablet in the morning and 1 tablet in the evening or as directed by physician. It is best taken with or just after main meals with a full glass of water.
Children 3-7 years

Interaction





                            The risk of hypercalcemia should be considered in patients taking thiazide diuretics since these drugs can reduce urinary calcium excretion. Hypocalcaemia must be avoided in digitalized patients. Certain foods (e.g. those containing oxalic acid, phosphate or phytinic acid) may reduce the absorption of calcium. Concomitant treatment with phenytoin or barbiturates can decrease the effect of Vitamin-D 3 because of metabolic activation. Concomitant use of glucocorticoids can decrease the effect of Vitamin D3. The effects of digitalis and other cardiac glycosides may be attenuated with the oral administration of calcium combined with Vitamin-D 3 . Strict medical supervision is needed and, if necessary monitoring of ECG and calcium. Calcium salts may reduce the absorption of thyroxin, bisphosphonates, sodium fluoride, quinolone or tetracycline antibiotics or iron. It is advisable to allow a minimum period of four hours before taking the calcium.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Absolute contraindications are hypercalcaemia resulting from myeloma, bone metastasis or other malignant bone disease, sarcoidosis; primary hyperparathyroidism and Vitamin-D 3 overdosage, Severe renal failure. Hypersensitivity to any of the tablet ingredients. Relative contraindications are osteoporosis due to prolonged immobilisation, renal stones, severe hypercalciuria.
                    










Side Effects





                            The use of calcium supplements has rarely given rise to mild gastro-intestinal disturbances such as constipation, flatulence, nausea, gastric pain, diarrhea. Following administration of vitamin-D3 supplements occasional skin rash has been reported. Hypercalciuria and in rare cases hypercalcaemia have been seen with long term treatment at high doses.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            During pregnancy and lactation treatment should always be under the direction of a physician. During pregnancy and lactation, requirements for calcium and vitamin-D 3 are increased but in deciding on the required supplementation allowances should be made for availability of these agents from other sources. If calcium and iron supplements are both required to be administered to the patient, they should be taken at different times. Overdoses of vitamin-D 3 have shown teratogenic effects in pregnant animals. In humans long term hypercalcaemia can lead to physical and mental retardation, aortic stenosis and retinopathy in a new born child. Vitamin-D 3 and its metabolites pass into the breast milk.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Patients with mild to moderate renal failure or mild hypercalciuria should be supervised carefully. Periodic checks of plasma calcium levels and urinary calcium excretion should be made in patients with mild to moderate renal failure or mild hypercalciuria. Urinary calcium excretion should also be measured. In patients with a history of renal stones urinary calcium excretion should be measured to exclude hypercalciuria. With long term treatment it is advisable to monitor serum and urinary calcium levels and kidney function, and reduce and stop treatment temporarily if urinary calcium exceeds 7.5 mmol/24 hours. Allowances should be made for calcium and vitamin D3 supplements from other sources.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Symptoms of overdosage may include nausea and vomiting, severe drowsiness, dry mouth, loss of appetite, metallic taste, stomach cramps, diarrhea, headache & constipation.

Pharmacology





                            Acyclovir is an antiviral agent which is highly active in vitro against Herpes simplex (HSV) types I and II and Varicella zoster viruses, but its toxicity to mammalian cells is low. Acyclovir is phosphorylated to the active compound Acyclovir triphosphate after entry into herpes infected cell. The ­first step in this process requires the presence of the viral-coded thymidine kinase. Acyclovir triphosphate acts as an inhibitor of and substrate for the herpes specifi­ed DNA polymerase preventing further viral DNA synthesis without affecting normal cellular processes.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            The dosage for all age groups is the same. A 10 mm ribbon of the ointment should be placed inside the lower conjunctival sac ­five times a day at approximately four hourly intervals. Treatment should continue for at least 3 days after healing

Pharmacology





                            Dexamethasone is a cortisone derivative whose high activity due to the presence of methyl group in the 16-alpha position and of a fluorine atom in the 9-alpha position. The result is that its anti-inflammatory activity is 30 times greater and its overall therapeutic effectiveness 8-10 times greater than that of hydrocortisone. Like other glucocorticoids, it is anti-allergic, anti-exudative and anti-proliferative. Therapeutic concentrations of Dexamethasone are found in both the cornea and aqueous humor 15-30 minutes after local application of single drop of 0.1% solution. These concentrations persist for 4-6 hours. The action of Dexamethasone is to inhibit the phospholipase A2, the first step in prostaglandin synthesis. Also, Dexamethasone inhibits the chemotactic infiltration of neutrophils into the site of inflammation.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Dexamethasone ophthalmic solution
: Instill 1 drop into the conjunctival sac 3-5 times per day. Acute cases: up to 1 drop every hour if necessary.
Dexamethasone ophthalmic ointment
: Apply a small amount into the conjunctival sac 3-4 times per day. Slowly close your eyes without blinking. Keep your eyes closed for 1 to 2 minutes. Minimize the dose when desired improvement is observed.

Interaction





                            Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with Acicot.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Injuries and ulcerating processes of the cornea, particularly those of bacterial or viral origin (herpes simplex, vaccinia), purulent infections of the conjunctiva and eyelids, tuberculosis, mycosis, glaucoma.
                    










Side Effects





                            In predisposed patients, application of corticosteroids for a period of several weeks may cause a reversible rise in intraocular pressure. Pressure measurements at regular intervals are therefore essential.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Animal experiments with dexamethasone have shown adverse effect on the fetus. However, no control human studies are available. Dexamethasone ophthalmic preparation should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Corticosteroids may mask, activate or aggravate an infection of the eye. If no improvement is seen after a few days application, other form of treatment should be used. Do not touch dropper tip to any surface as this may contaminated the ophthalmic solution or ointment.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Overdose through local or accidental oral administration is not likely.
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Store at room temperature & protect from light. It is desirable that the contents should not be used more than one month after first opening of the bottle.

Pharmacology





                            Zoledronic acid belongs to the class of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralized bone. Intravenously administered Zoledronic acid is rapidly distributed to bone. The main molecular target of Zoledronic acid in the osteoclast is the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, but this does not exclude other mechanisms. Clinical studies in tumour-induced hypercalcemia demonstrated that the effect of Zoledronic acid is characterized by decreases in serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion. In addition to its inhibitory activity against bone resorption, Zoledronic acid also possesses anti-tumour activity, anti-angiogenic activity, anti-pain activity, cytostatic and pro-apoptotic activity on tumour cells and synergistic cytostatic effect with other anti-cancer drugs. There was no accumulation of the active substance in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. Zoledronic acid is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged via the kidney.
                    
























Dosage






Hypercalcemia of malignancy
: The maximum recommended dose of Zoledronic Acid in hypercalcemia of malignancy (serum calcium 12 mg/dl or 3.0 mmol/l) is 4 mg. The 4 mg dose must be given as a single-dose intravenous infusion. Dose adjustment of Zoledronic Acid is not necessary in treating patients for hypercalcemia of malignancy presenting with mild-to-moderate renal impairment. Re-treatment with Zoledronic Acid may be considered if serum calcium does not return to normal after initial treatment. It is recommended that a minimum of 7 days elapse before re-treatment, to allow for full response to the initial dose. 
Multiple myeloma and bone metastases of solid tumors
: The recommended dose of Zoledronic Acid in patients with multiple myeloma and metastatic bone lesions from solid tumors is 4 mg infused every 3-4 weeks. Patients should also be administered an oral calcium supplement of 500 mg and 400 IU of Vitamin-D daily.
                    




* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন
'




















Administration





                            Prior to administration, the required amount of concentrate from one vial must be further diluted with 100 ml of calcium-free infusion solution (0.9% w/v sodium chloride solution or 5% w/v glucose solution). The duration of infusion must not be less than 15 minutes. After addition of the solution to the infusion media, the infusion solution should be used as soon as possible. If storage of the infusion solution is necessary, hold at 2-8º C for not more than 24 hours. If refrigerated, the solution must be allowed to reach room temperature before administration.
Zoledronic Acid must not be mixed with calcium or other divalent cation-containing infusion solutions, such as Lactated Ringer's solution, and should be administered as a single intravenous solution in a line separate from all other drugs.

Interaction





                            In clinical studies, Acidron has been administered concomitantly with commonly used anticancer agents, diuretics, antibiotics and analgesics without interactions. Caution is advised when Acidron are administered with aminoglycosides, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. In multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal dysfunction may be increased when Acidron is used in combination with thalidomide. Concomitant use of loop diuretics with Acidron increases the risk of hypocalcemia. Caution is indicated when Acidron is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs.
                    




















Contraindications





                            The drug is contraindicated if patients have hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to any bisphosphonates; severe renal impairment (Creatinine clearance <30 ml/min); pregnancy and lactation.
                    










Side Effects





                            The post-dose side-effects are headache, nausea, anorexia, fatigue, osteonecrosis of jaw, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, flu-like syndrome, hypocalcemia, myalgia, arthralgia and hypophosphataemia.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Zoledronic acid is contraindicated during pregnancy and in breast-feeding women. It is also not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Patients must be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of Acidron. This is especially important in the elderly and for patients receiving diuretic therapy. Adequate hydration can be achieved by the patient drinking two glasses of fluid (such as water) before and after the infusion. Serum levels of calcium, phosphate, magnesium and potassium, as well as serum creatinine should be carefully monitored after initiating Acidron therapy. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia or hypomagnesemia occurs, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. Moreover, careful renal function monitoring should be considered.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Patients with renal impairment
: The use of Acidron is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (Creatinine clearance <30 ml/min). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance >60 ml/min. Based on creatinine clearance the following dose should be used in patient with impaired renal function:




CrCl > 60 ml/min: 4 mg (5 ml)


CrCl 50-60 ml/min: 3.5 mg (4.4 ml)


CrCl 40-49 ml/min: 3.3 mg (4.1 ml)


CrCl 30-39 ml/min: 3 mg (3.8 ml)












Overdose Effects





                            Clinical experience with acute over dosage is limited. Over dosage may cause hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia. In such case, reduction in serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium should be corrected by intravenous administration of calcium gluconate, potassium or sodium phosphate and magnesium sulfate respectively.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Bisphosphonate preparations

Pharmacology





                            Rabeprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H
+
/K
+
-ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.
                    
























Dosage






Active Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer
: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.
Erosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)
: The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.
Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance)
: For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.
Symptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD)
: 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.
Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg)
: 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.
Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more)
: 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. 
Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome
: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.
Eradication of H. pylori
: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.

Administration





                            For indications requiring once-daily treatment Rabeprazole tablets should be taken in the morning, before eating; and although neither the time of day nor food intake was shown to have any effect on rabeprazole sodium activity, this regimen will facilitate treatment compliance. Patients should be cautioned that the Rabeprazole tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.

Interaction





                            Respite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Acifix with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.
                    










Side Effects





                            In general, Acifix is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Acifix may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            US FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings








Symptomatic response to therapy with Acifix does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Acifix 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.


Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.


Proton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10–40%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.


A risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.


Patients should be cautioned that Acifix gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.


There have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.


Hepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.


No evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Acifix 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.


Co-administration of atazanavir with Acifix is not recommended.


Treatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.




Hypomagnesaemia
: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.
Influence on vitamin B12 absorption
: Acifix, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.
Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE)
: Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Acifix. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.
Interference with laboratory tests
: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Acifix 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Renal and hepatic impairment
: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
Pediatric populations
: Acifix is not recommended for use in children due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            The maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are  generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Acifix is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.

Pharmacology





                            Sparfloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent that inhibit DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV and kills many of the types of bacteria that can infect the breathing airways and lungs and has been shown in a large number of clinical trials to be safe and effective for the treatment of bacterial infections. It is found to be more effective in vitro than other fluoroquinolones against some gram positive organisms (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureous), Mycobacteria and Chlamydia spp.
Absorption
: Quinoflox‚ is well absorbed following oral administration with an absolute oral bioavailability of 92%. The mean maximum plasma sparfloxacin concentration following a single 400-mg oral dose was approximately 1.3 (±0.2) µg/mL. The area under the curve following a single 400-mg oral dose was approximately 34 (±6.8) µg·hr/mL. Steady-state plasma concentration was achieved on the first day by giving a loading dose that was double the daily dose. Maximum plasma concentrations for a 200 mg dose were also achieved between 3 to 6 hours after administration with a mean of about 4 hours. Oral absorption of sparfloxacin is unaffected by administration with milk or food, including high fat meals. Concurrent administration of antacids containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide reduces the oral bioavailability of sparfloxacin by as much as 50%.
Distribution
: Upon reaching general circulation, Quinoflox‚ distributes well into the body, as reflected by the large mean steady-state volume of distribution (Vdss ) of 3.9 (±0.8) L/kg. Sparfloxacin exhibits low plasma protein binding in serum at about 45%. Sparfloxacin penetrates well into body fluids and tissues. Results of tissue and body fluid distribution studies demonstrated that oral administration of sparfloxacin produces sustained concentrations and that sparfloxacin concentrations in lower respiratory tract tissues and fluids generally exceed the corresponding plasma concentrations. The concentration of sparfloxacin in respiratory tissues (pulmonary parenchyma, bronchial wall, and bronchial mucosa) at 2 to 6 hours following standard oral dosing was approximately 3 to 6 times greater than the corresponding concentration in plasma. Concentrations in these respiratory tissues increase at up to 24 hours following dosing. Sparfloxacin is also highly concentrated into alveolar macrophages compared to plasma. Mean pleural effusion to plasma concentration ratios were 0.34 and 0.69 at 4 and 20 hours postdose, respectively.
Metabolism
: Quinoflox‚ is metabolised by the liver, primarily by phase II glucuronidation, to form a glucuronide conjugate. Its metabolism does not utilize or interfere with cytochrome-mediated oxidation, in particular cytochrome P450.
Excretion
: The total body clearance and renal clearance of Quinoflox‚ were 11.4 (±3.5) and 1.5 (±0.5) L/hr, respectively. Sparfloxacin is excreted in both the feces (50%) and urine (50%). Approximately 10% of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug in patients with normal renal function.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            The recommended daily dose of Sparfloxacin‚ in patients with normal renal function is two 200 mg tablets taken on the first day as a loading dose. Thereafter, one 200 mg tablet should be taken every 24 hours for a total of 10 days of therapy (11 tablets). The recommended daily dose of Sparfloxacin‚ in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) is two 200 mg tablets taken on the first day as a loading dose. Thereafter, one 200-mg tablet should be taken every 48 hours for a total of 9 days of therapy (6 tablets).

Interaction





                            Aluminium and Magnesium cations in antacids and sucralfate form chelation complexes with Aciflox. Concomitant use with medications known to produce an increase in the QTc interval and/or Torsade de pointes (e.g., terfenadine). Aciflox does not interact with theophylline or caffeine, nor with warfarin or cimetidine. Probenecid does not alter the pharmacokinetics of Aciflox.
                    




















Contraindications








Sparfloxacin is contraindicated to the patients who are hypersensitive to any of its ingredient


Pregnancy and lactation


Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G
6
PD) deficiency


History of Achilles tendinitis following the use of fluoroquinolones














Side Effects





                            Most of the side effects are mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. The most frequently reported events with the recommended dosage were: Photosensitivity reaction, Diarrhea, Nausea, Headache, Dyspepsia, Dizziness, Insomnia, Abdominal pain, Pruritus, Taste perversion, QTc interval prolongation, Vomiting, Flatulence, Vasodilatation.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Sparfloxacin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
                    








Precautions & Warnings






Special warnings
: Moderate to severe phototoxic reactions have occurred in patients exposed to direct or indirect sunlight or to artificial ultraviolet light (e.g., sunlamps) during or following treatment. Patients should be advised to discontinue Aciflox therapy at the first signs or symptoms of a phototoxicity reaction such as:




Sensation of skin burning


Swelling


Rash


Itching


Dermatitis


Increases in the QTc interval.



The safety and effectiveness of Aciflox in children, adolescents (under the age of 18 years), pregnant women, and lactating women have not been established.
Precaution
-




Adequate hydration of patients receiving Aciflox should be maintained to prevent the formation of a highly concentrated urine.


Administer Aciflox with caution in the presence of renal insufficiency.


Avoid the concomitant prescription of medications known to prolong the QTc interval, e.g., erythromycin, terfenadine etc.


Excessive exposure to sunlight should be avoided.












Use in Special Populations






Geriatric
: The pharmacokinetics of Aciflox‚ are not altered in the elderly with normal renal function.
Paediatric
: The pharmacokinetics of Aciflox in paediatric subjects have not been studied.
Gender
: There are no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of Aciflox.
Renal insufficiency
: In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), the terminal elimination half-life of Aciflox is lengthened. Single or multiple doses of Aciflox in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment typically produce plasma concentrations that are twice those observed in subjects with normal renal function.
Hepatic impairment
: The pharmacokinetics of Aciflox are not altered in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis.

Composition





                            Each ml solution contains 100 IU (equivalent to 3.50 mg) Insulin Aspart (rDNA).
                    




















Description





                            Acilog rDNA is a sterile, clear solution of Acilog human insulin analogue for subcutaneous injection/infusion or intravenous injection. This is a blood glucose lowering agent with an earlier onset of action. It produces a more rapid onset of action compared to soluble human insulin. Acilog is homologous with regular human insulin with the exception of a single substitution of the amino acid Proline by aspartic acid in position B28, and is produced by recombinant DNA technology.
                    




















Pharmacology





                            The primary activity of Insulin Aspart is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin Aspart bind to the insulin receptors on muscle and fat cells and lower blood glucose by facilitating the cellular uptake of glucose and simultaneously inhibiting the output of glucose from the liver.
                    
























Dosage





                            Insulin Aspart has a faster onset and a shorter duration of action than soluble human insulin. Due to the faster onset of action, Insulin Aspart should generally be given immediately before a meal. When necessary Insulin Aspart may be given soon after a meal.
Dosage of Insulin Aspart is individual and determined on the basis of the physician's advice in accordance with the needs of the patient. It should normally be used in combination with long-acting insulin given at least once a day.
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.5 and 1.0 IU/kg/day in adults and children over 2 years of age. In a meal-related treatment 50-70% of this requirement may be provided by Insulin Aspart and the remainder by long-acting insulin. Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or change their usual diet. Exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia.
Subcutaneous Injection
: Insulin Aspart should be administered by subcutaneous injection in the abdominal region, buttocks, thigh, or upper arm. Because Insulin Aspart has a more rapid onset and a shorter duration of activity than human regular insulin, it should be injected immediately (within 5-10 minutes) before a meal Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) by External Pump Insulin Aspart can also be infused subcutaneously by an external insulin pump. The initial programming of the external insulin infusion pump should be based on the total daily insulin dose of the previous regimen. Approximately 50% of the total dose is usually given as meal-related boluses of Insulin Aspart and the remainder is given as a basal infusion. When used with an infusion pump Insulin Aspart should not be mixed with any other insulin.
Intravenous Use
: Insulin Aspart can be administered intravenously under medical supervision for glycemic control with close monitoring of blood glucose and potassium levels to avoid hypoglycemia and hypokalemia. For intravenous use, Insulin Aspart should be used at concentrations from 0.05 IU/mL to 1.0 IU/mL insulin aspart in infusion systems using polypropylene infusion bags. Insulin Aspart has been shown to be stable in infusion fluids such as 0.9% sodium chloride.

Interaction





                            A number of drugs affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment. 
The following substances may reduce the Acilog as well as Acilog requirements: Oral anti-diabetic products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.
The following substances may increase the Acilog as well as Acilog requirements: Thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, beta-sympathomimetics, growth hormone and danazol. Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood glucose lowering effect of insulin.
                    






















Side Effects





                            Side effects of Acilog are hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reaction, lipodystrophy, pruritus and rash.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy category B. There are no restrictions on treatment with Protamine Crystallised Insulin Aspart during lactation. Insulin treatment of the nursing mother should not affect the baby. However, dosage may need to be adjusted.
                    








Precautions & Warnings






Dose adjustment and monitoring
: Blood glucose should be monitored in all patients treated with insulin. Acilog regimens should be modified cautiously and only under medical supervision
                    








Overdose Effects





                            A specific overdose for insulin cannot be defined, however, hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages if too high doses relative to the patient’s requirement are administered. Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products. Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated by glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Glucose must also be given intravenously if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon regaining consciousness administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse.

Composition





                            Each ml suspension contains Insulin Aspart (rDNA) 100 units (equivalent to 3.5 mg) as 30% soluble Insulin Aspart and 70% Insulin Aspart Protamine suspension
                    
































Pharmacology





                            30% Insulin Aspart and 70% Insulin Aspart Protamine (rDNA) is a human insulin analog suspension containing 30 % soluble Insulin Aspart and 70% Insulin Aspart Protamine crystals. This is a blood glucose lowering agent with an earlier onset and an intermediate duration of action. Insulin Aspart is homologous with regular human insulin with the exception of a single substitution of the proline by aspartic acid in position B28, and is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker’s yeast).
Primary function of insulin, including Insulin Aspart, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, primarily by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.
                    
























Dosage





                            The dosage of insulin aspart must be individualized.
Subcutaneous injection
: insulin aspart should generally be given immediately (within 5-10 minutes) prior to the start of a meal.
Use in pumps
: Change the insulin aspart in the reservoir at least every 6 days, change the infusion set, and the infusion set insertion site at least every 3 days. insulin aspart should not be mixed with other insulins or with a diluent when it is used in the pump.
Intravenous use
: insulin aspart should be used at concentrations from 0.05 U/mL to 1.0 U/mL insulin aspart in infusion systems using polypropylene infusion bags. insulin aspart has been shown to be stable in infusion fluids such as 0.9% sodiumchloride.

Administration





                            Before going for administration of Biphasic Insulin Aspart (rDNA) please follow the below mentioned check list:




Insulin syringe of the right size (100 units/ml)


Prescribed type of insulin injection


Check the expiry date on Biphasic Insulin Aspart (rDNA) vial


Ensure that the flip off cap on the Biphasic Insulin Aspart (rDNA) vial is intact



After that follow the below mentioned instructions:




Wash your hands carefully. Shake or roll the vial 10 times to completely Mix the insulin.


lnspect the vial. Vial should appear white and cloudy after mixing.


When using a new vial, flip off the plastic protective cap, but do not remove the stopper. The tip of the vial should be wiped with an alcohol swab.


Draw air into the syringe equal to your insulin dose.


Insert needle into vial through rubber top & push plunger to empty the air into the vial.


Turn the bottle and syringe upside down. Hold the bottle and syringe firmly in one hand and shake gently. Make sure that the tip of the needle is in the liquid; withdraw the correct dose of insulin into the syringe.


Before removing the needle from the vial, check the insulin syringe for air bubbles, which reduces the amount of insulin in it, if bubbles are present, hold the insulin straight up and tap its side until the bubbles float to the top. Push them out with the plunger and withdraw the correct dose again.


Lightly pinch up the skin, holding the syringe like a pencil.


Insert the needle into the skin & push the plunger slowly. Make sure that the needle is all the way in.


Wait for 5 seconds & pull out the syringe. Do not rub the area.

Interaction





                            A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring.
The following are examples that may increase the blood glucose lowering effect and susceptibility to hypoglycemia
: oral anti-diabetic products, pramlintide and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.
The following substances are examples that may reduce the blood glucose lowering effect
: corticosteroids, niacin, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, estrogens, progestogens, atypical antipsychotics and danazol. Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Biphasic Insulin Aspart (rDNA) is contraindicated




During episodes of hypoglycemia


In patients with hypersensitivity to Insulin Aspart or any of its excipients.














Side Effects





                            Side effects of Insulin Aspart are hypoglycemia, lipodystrophy, weight gain, peripheral edema.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy category B. Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential in such patients because insulin requirements change during different stages of pregnancy. Therefore female patients should be advised to tell their physician if they intend to become or if they become pregnant while taking insulin aspart
Lactation: It is unknown whether Insulin Aspart is excreted in human milk as occurs with human insulin. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of the use of insulin aspart in lactating women. Lactating Women may require adjustments of their insulin doses.
                    








Precautions & Warnings






Dose adjustment and monitoring
: Blood glucose should be monitored in all patients treated with insulin. Insulin regimens should be modified cautiously and only under medical supervision. 
Renal or hepatic impairment
: Reduction in the Insulin Aspart dose may require in these cases.

Pharmacology





                            Ranitidine competitively blocks histamine at H2-receptors of the gastric parietal cells which inhibits gastric acid secretion. It does not affect pepsin secretion, pentagastrin-stimulated intrinsic factor secretion or serum gastrin.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Ranitidine Tablet & Syrup:


Duodenal and gastric ulcer
: The usual dosage is 150 mg twice daily taken in the morning and evening or 300 mg as a single daily dose at night for 4 to 8 weeks.
Reflux oesophagitis
: 150 mg twice daily or 300 mg at bed time for up to 8 weeks.
Zollinger Ellison syndrome
: 150 mg 3 times daily and increased if necessary up to 6 g daily in divided doses. Dosage should be continued as long as clinically indicated.
Episodic dyspepsia
: 150 mg twice daily or 300 mg at bed time for up to 6 weeks.
Maintenance
: 150 mg at night for preventing recurrences.
Child (peptic ulcer)
: 2-4 mg/kg twice daily, maximum 300 mg daily.


Ranitidine IV injection & IV Infusion:

Ranitidine injection may be given either as a slow (over a period of at least two minutes) intravenous injection of 50 mg, after dilution to a volume of 20 ml per 50 mg dose, which may be repeated every six to eight hours; or as an intermittent intravenous infusion at a rate of 25 mg per hour for two hours; the infusion may be repeated at six to eight hour intervals; or as an intramuscular injection of 50 mg (2 ml) every six to eight hours. In the prophylaxis of haemorrhage from stress ulceration in seriously ill patients or the prophylaxis of recurrent haemorrhage in patients bleeding from peptic ulceration, parenteral administration may be continued until oral feeding commences.
In the prophylaxis of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage from stress ulceration in seriously ill patient sapriming dose of 50 mg as low as intravenous injection followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of 0.125-0.250 mg/kg/hour may be preferred. In patients considered to be at risk of developing aspiration syndrome Ranitidine injection 50 mg may be given intramuscularly or by slow intravenous injection 45 to 60 minutes before induction of general anaesthesia.
Children
: The recommended oral dose for the treatment of peptic ulcer in children is 2 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg twice daily to a maximum of 300 mg ranitidine per day. Safety and effectiveness of Ranitidine injection have not been established in case of children.

Interaction





                            Delayed absorption and increased peak serum concentration with propantheline bromide. Acin minimally inhibits hepatic metabolism of coumarin anticoagulants, theophylline, diazepam and propanolol. May alter absorption of pH-dependent drugs (e.g. ketoconazole, midazolam, glipizide). May reduce bioavailability with antacids.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Patients hypersensitive to Ranitidine
                    










Side Effects





                            Acin is well tolerated and side effects are usually uncommon. Altered bowel habit, dizziness, rash, tiredness, reversible confusional states, headache, decreased blood counts, muscle or joint pain have rarely been reported.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation






Pregnancy
: Ranitidine crosses the placenta. But there is no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the foetus due to Ranitidine. Like other drugs, Ranitidine should only be used during pregnancy if considered essential.
Lactation
: Ranitidine is excreted in human breast milk. Caution should be exercised when the drug is administered to a nursing mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Acin should be given in reduced dosage to patients with impaired renal and hepatic function.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Use in elderly patients
: In clinical trial the ulcer healing rates have been found similar in patients age 65 and over with those in younger patients. Additionally, there was no difference in the incidence of adverse effects.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Acin is very specific in action and accordingly no particular problems are expected following overdosage with the drug. Symptomatic and supportive therapy should be given as appropriate. If required, the drug may be removed from the plasma by haemodiaiysis.

Pharmacology





                            Escitalopram is an orally administered selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Escitalopram is the pure S-enantiomer of the racemic bicyclic phthalate derivative citalopram. Escitalopram is at least 100 fold more potent than the R-enantiomer with respect to inhibition of 5-HT reuptake. Escitalopram has no or very low affinity for serotonergic or other receptors including alpha- and beta-adrenergic Dopamine, Histamine, Muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors.
                    
























Dosage





                            Safety of daily doses above 20 mg has not been demonstrated. Escitalopram Oxalate is administered as a single daily dose and may be taken with or without food.
Major depressive episodes
: Usual dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Usually, 2-4 weeks are necessary to obtain an antidepressant response. After the symptoms resolve, treatment for at least 6 months is required for consolidation of the response.
Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia
: An initial dose of 5 mg is recommended for the first week before increasing the dose to 10 mg daily. The dose may be further increased, up to a maximum of 20 mg daily, dependent on individual patient response. Maximum effectiveness is reached after about 3 months. The treatment lasts several months.
Social anxiety disorder
: Usual dosage is 10 mg once daily. Usually, 2-4 weeks are necessary to obtain symptom relief. The dose may subsequently, depending on individual patient response, be decreased to 5 mg or increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Social anxiety disorder is a disease with a chronic course, and treatment for 12 weeks is recommended to consolidate response. Long-term treatment of responders has been studied for 6 months and can be considered on an individual basis to prevent relapse; treatment benefits should be re-evaluated at regular intervals. Social anxiety disorder is a well-defined diagnostic terminology of a specific disorder, which should not be confounded with excessive shyness. Pharmacotherapy is only indicated if the disorder interferes significantly with professional and social activities. The place of this treatment compared to cognitive behavioural therapy has not been assessed. Pharmacotherapy is part of an overall therapeutic strategy.
Generalised anxiety disorder
: Initial dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Long term treatment of responders has been studied for at least 6 months in patients receiving 20 mg/day. Treatment benefits and dose should be re-evaluated at regular intervals.
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
: Initial dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. As OCD is a chronic disease, patients should be treated for a sufficient period to ensure that they are symptom-free. Treatment benefits and dose should be re-evaluated at regular intervals.

Interaction





                            As SSRI or related antidepressants should not be started until 2 weeks after stopping an MAOI. Conversely, an MAOI should not. be started until at least a week after an SSRI or related antidepressant has been stopped (2 weeks in the case of paroxetine and sertraline, at least 5 weeks in the case of fluoxetine).
                    




















Contraindications





                            Escitalopram is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Escitalopram or Citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients of the drug product. Concomitant use of escitalopram in patients taking monoamine oxidase/pimozide is contraindicated.
                    










Side Effects





                            SSRIs are less sedating and have fewer antimuscarinic and cardiotoxic effects than tricyclic antidepressants. Side-effects of the SSRIs include gastrointestinal effects (dose-related and fairly common include nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation), anorexia with weight loss (increased appetite and weight gain also reported) and hypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, arthralgia, myalgia, and photosensitivity; other side-effects include dry mouth, nervousness, anxiety, headache, insomnia, tremor, dizziness, asthenia, hallucinations, drowsiness, convulsions, galactorrhoea, sexual dysfunction, urinary retention, sweating, hypomania or mania, movement disorders and dyskinesias, visual disturbances.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            When treating a pregnant woman with Escitalopram during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. It is excreted in human breast milk. The decision whether to continue or discontinue either nursing or Escitalopram therapy should take into account the risk of citalopram exposure for the infant and the benefits Escitalopram treatment for the mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            SSRIs should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy (avoid if poorly controlled, discontinue if convulsions develop), concurrent electroconvulsive therapy (prolonged seizures reported with fluoxetine), history of mania, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, angle-closure glaucoma, concomitant use of drugs that increase risk of bleeding, history of bleeding disorders (especially gastro-lntestinal bleeding), hepatic and renal impairment.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Elderly patients (>65 years of age)
: Initial dosage is 5 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. The efficacy of escitalopram in social anxiety disorder has not been studied in elderly patients.
Children and adolescents (<18 years)
: Acipam should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.
Reduced renal function
: Dosage adjustment is not necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Caution is advised in patients with severely reduced renal function (CLCR less than 30 ml/min).
Reduced hepatic function
: An initial dose of 5 mg daily for the first two weeks of treatment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Caution and extra careful dose titration is advised in patients with severely reduced hepatic function.
Poor metabolizers of CYP2C19
: For patients who are known to be poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2C19, an initial dose of 5 mg daily during the first two weeks of treatment is recommended. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Discontinuation symptoms seen when stopping treatment. Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided. 
When stopping treatment with escitalopram the dose should be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of discontinuation symptoms. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate.
                    








Overdose Effects






Symptoms
: Symptoms seen in a reported overdose of escitalopram include symptoms mainly related to the central nervous system (ranging from dizziness, tremor, and agitation to rare cases of serotonin syndrome, convulsion, and coma), the gastrointestinal system (nausea/vomiting), and the cardiovascular system (hypotension, tachycardia, QT interval, prolongation, and arrhythmia) and electrolyte/fluid balance conditions (hypokalaemia, hyponatremia).
Management
: There is no specific antidote. Establish and maintain an airway, ensure adequate oxygenation and respiratory function. Gastric lavage and the use of activated charcoal should be considered. Gastric lavage should be carried out as soon as possible after oral ingestion. Cardiac and vital signs monitoring are recommended along with general symptomatic supportive measures. ECG monitoring is advised in case of overdose, in patients with congestive heart failure/bradyarrhythmias, in patients using concomitant medications that prolong the QT-interval, or in patients with altered metabolism, e.g. liver impairment.

Pharmacology





                            Ceftriaxone is a 3rd generation broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic. It has potent bactericidal activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Like other cephalosporins and penicillins, Ceftriaxone kills bacteria by interfering with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound. The drug is highly protein bound (95%).
                    
























Dosage






Adult
: The usual dose is 1 to 2 gm by intravenous or intramuscular administration once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day).




Pneumonia, Bronchitis, Acute bacterial otitis media, Skin and skin structure infection, Urinary tract infections, Bacterial Septicemia, Bone and joint infections, Meningitis
: 1 to 2 g IV or IM once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day); Maximum dose: 4 gm/day


Uncomplicated gonococcal infections
: 250 mg IM as a single dose


Surgical prophylaxis
: 1 g IV as a single dose 30 to 120 minutes before surgery




Infants and Children (01 month or older)
: The usual dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg intravenous or intramuscular administration once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day).




Pneumonia, Bronchitis, Skin and skin structure infection, Urinary tract infections, Bacterial Septicemia, Bone and joint infections
: 50 to 75 mg/kg IV or IM once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day); Maximum dose: 2 gm/day


Acute bacterial otitis media
: 50 mg/kg IM in single dose; Maximum dose: 1 gm/day


Meningitis
: 100 mg/kg IV or IM in single daily dose or (or in equally divided doses twice a day); Maximum dose: 4 gm/day

Administration





                            Preparation of Solutions for Intramuscular / Intravenous Injections:




For Intramuscular Injection
: 250 mg or 500 mg Ceftriaxone should be dissolved in 2 ml Lidocaine HCI 1% injection or 1 g Ceftriaxone in 3.5 ml of Lidocaine HCI 1% injection.


For Intravenous Injection
: 250 mg or 500 mg Ceftriaxone should be dissolved in 5 ml of Water for injection or 1 g Ceftriaxone in 10 ml of Water for injection USP or 2 g Ceftriaxone in 20 ml of Water for injection.



The injection should be administered over 2-4 minutes, by Intramuscular or Intravenous injection or by tubing infusion over a period of 30 minutes at concentration between 10 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL. Before starting treatment through Ceftriaxone injection, patient tolerance test should be checked by administration of a test dose. (The use of freshly reconstituted solution is recommended. However, it maintains potency for at least 6 hours at room temperature or 24 hours at 5°C).

Interaction





                            No drug interactions have been reported.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Ceftriaxone should not be given to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.
                    










Side Effects





                            Aciphin is generally well tolerated. A few side effects such as gastro-intestinal effects including diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, stomatitis and glossitis; cutaneous reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, edema and erythema multiforme; hematologic reactions including eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, anemia and neutropenia; hepatic reactions including elevations of SGOT or SGPT, bilirubinemia; CNS reactions including nervousness, confusion, sleep disturbances, headache, hyperactivity, convulsion, hypertonia and dizziness were reported. Local phlebitis occurs rarely following intravenous administration but can be minimized by slow injections over 2-4 minutes.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Its safety in human pregnancy has not been established. Therefore, it should not be used in pregnancy unless absolutely indicated. Low concentrations of Ceftriaxone are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Ceftriaxone is administered to a lactating mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            As with other cephalosporins, anaphylactic shock cannot be ruled out even if a thorough patient history is taken. Anaphylactic shock requires immediate countermeasures such as intravenous epinephrine followed by a glucocorticoid. In rare cases, shadows suggesting sludge have been detected by sonograms of the gallbladder. This condition was reversible on discontinuation or completion of Aciphin therapy. Even if such findings are associated with pain, conservative, nonsurgical management is recommended. During prolonged treatment the blood picture should be checked at regular intervals.
                    








Use in Special Populations





                            Aciphin must not be given to neonates if the neonates is premature and newborn (up to 28 days of age).
                    








Overdose Effects





                            There is no specific antidote. Treatment of overdosage should be symptomatic.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Third generation Cephalosporins
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Vial store in a cool, dry place (below 30° C), away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.

Interaction





                            No drug interactions have been reported.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Ceftriaxone should not be given to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.
                    










Side Effects





                            Aciphin is generally well tolerated. A few side effects such as gastro-intestinal effects including diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, stomatitis and glossitis; cutaneous reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, edema and erythema multiforme; hematologic reactions including eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, anemia and neutropenia; hepatic reactions including elevations of SGOT or SGPT, bilirubinemia; CNS reactions including nervousness, confusion, sleep disturbances, headache, hyperactivity, convulsion, hypertonia and dizziness were reported. Local phlebitis occurs rarely following intravenous administration but can be minimized by slow injections over 2-4 minutes.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Its safety in human pregnancy has not been established. Therefore, it should not be used in pregnancy unless absolutely indicated. Low concentrations of Ceftriaxone are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Ceftriaxone is administered to a lactating mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            As with other cephalosporins, anaphylactic shock cannot be ruled out even if a thorough patient history is taken. Anaphylactic shock requires immediate countermeasures such as intravenous epinephrine followed by a glucocorticoid. In rare cases, shadows suggesting sludge have been detected by sonograms of the gallbladder. This condition was reversible on discontinuation or completion of Aciphin therapy. Even if such findings are associated with pain, conservative, nonsurgical management is recommended. During prolonged treatment the blood picture should be checked at regular intervals.
                    








Use in Special Populations





                            Aciphin must not be given to neonates if the neonates is premature and newborn (up to 28 days of age).
                    








Overdose Effects





                            There is no specific antidote. Treatment of overdosage should be symptomatic.
                    








Therapeutic Class

Pharmacology





                            Ceftriaxone is a 3rd generation broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic. It has potent bactericidal activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Like other cephalosporins and penicillins, Ceftriaxone kills bacteria by interfering with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound. The drug is highly protein bound (95%).
                    
























Dosage






Adult
: The usual dose is 1 to 2 gm by intravenous or intramuscular administration once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day).

: 1 to 2 g IV or IM once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day); Maximum dose: 4 gm/day


Uncomplicated gonococcal infections
: 250 mg IM as a single dose


Surgical prophylaxis

Infants and Children (01 month or older)
: The usual dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg intravenous or intramuscular administration once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day).

Pharmacology





                            Ceftriaxone is a 3rd generation broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic. It has potent bactericidal activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Like other cephalosporins and penicillins, Ceftriaxone kills bacteria by interfering with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta lactamases. A remarkable feature of Ceftriaxone is its relatively long plasma elimination half-life of about 6 to 9 hours, which makes single or once-daily dosage of the drug appropriate for most patients. Ceftriaxone is not metabolized in the body. About 40-65% of a dose of Ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is excreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as unchanged drug and microbiologically inactive compound. The drug is highly protein bound (95%).
                    
























Dosage






Adult
: The usual dose is 1 to 2 gm by intravenous or intramuscular administration once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day).




Pneumonia, Bronchitis, Acute bacterial otitis media, Skin and skin structure infection, Urinary tract infections, Bacterial Septicemia, Bone and joint infections, Meningitis
: 1 to 2 g IV or IM once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day); Maximum dose: 4 gm/day


Uncomplicated gonococcal infections
: 250 mg IM as a single dose


Surgical prophylaxis
: 1 g IV as a single dose 30 to 120 minutes before surgery




Infants and Children (01 month or older)
: The usual dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg intravenous or intramuscular administration once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day).




Pneumonia, Bronchitis, Skin and skin structure infection, Urinary tract infections, Bacterial Septicemia, Bone and joint infections
: 50 to 75 mg/kg IV or IM once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day); Maximum dose: 2 gm/day


Acute bacterial otitis media
: 50 mg/kg IM in single dose; Maximum dose: 1 gm/day


Meningitis
: 100 mg/kg IV or IM in single daily dose or (or in equally divided doses twice a day); Maximum dose: 4 gm/day




Duration of therapy
: Continue for more than 2 days after signs and symptoms of infection have disappeared. Usual duration is 4 to 14 days; in complicated infections, longer therapy may be required.

Administration





                            Preparation of Solutions for Intramuscular / Intravenous Injections:




For Intramuscular Injection
: 250 mg or 500 mg Ceftriaxone should be dissolved in 2 ml Lidocaine HCI 1% injection or 1 g Ceftriaxone in 3.5 ml of Lidocaine HCI 1% injection.


For Intravenous Injection
: 250 mg or 500 mg Ceftriaxone should be dissolved in 5 ml of Water for injection or 1 g Ceftriaxone in 10 ml of Water for injection USP or 2 g Ceftriaxone in 20 ml of Water for injection.



The injection should be administered over 2-4 minutes, by Intramuscular or Intravenous injection or by tubing infusion over a period of 30 minutes at concentration between 10 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL. Before starting treatment through Ceftriaxone injection, patient tolerance test should be checked by administration of a test dose. (The use of freshly reconstituted solution is recommended. However, it maintains potency for at least 6 hours at room temperature or 24 hours at 5°C).

Interaction





                            No drug interactions have been reported.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Ceftriaxone should not be given to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.
                    










Side Effects





                            Aciphin is generally well tolerated. A few side effects such as gastro-intestinal effects including diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, stomatitis and glossitis; cutaneous reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, edema and erythema multiforme; hematologic reactions including eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, anemia and neutropenia; hepatic reactions including elevations of SGOT or SGPT, bilirubinemia; CNS reactions including nervousness, confusion, sleep disturbances, headache, hyperactivity, convulsion, hypertonia and dizziness were reported. Local phlebitis occurs rarely following intravenous administration but can be minimized by slow injections over 2-4 minutes.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Its safety in human pregnancy has not been established. Therefore, it should not be used in pregnancy unless absolutely indicated. Low concentrations of Ceftriaxone are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Ceftriaxone is administered to a lactating mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            As with other cephalosporins, anaphylactic shock cannot be ruled out even if a thorough patient history is taken. Anaphylactic shock requires immediate countermeasures such as intravenous epinephrine followed by a glucocorticoid. In rare cases, shadows suggesting sludge have been detected by sonograms of the gallbladder. This condition was reversible on discontinuation or completion of Aciphin therapy. Even if such findings are associated with pain, conservative, nonsurgical management is recommended. During prolonged treatment the blood picture should be checked at regular intervals.
                    








Use in Special Populations





                            Aciphin must not be given to neonates if the neonates is premature and newborn (up to 28 days of age).
                    








Overdose Effects





                            There is no specific antidote. Treatment of overdosage should be symptomatic.

Pharmacology





                            Rabeprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H
+
/K
+
-ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.

: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.
Erosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)
: The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.
Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance)
: For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.
Symptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD)
: 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.
Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg)
: 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.
Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more)
: 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. 
Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome
: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.
Eradication of H. pylori
: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.

Administration





                            For indications requiring once-daily treatment Rabeprazole tablets should be taken in the morning, before eating; and although neither the time of day nor food intake was shown to have any effect on rabeprazole sodium activity, this regimen will facilitate treatment compliance. Patients should be cautioned that the Rabeprazole tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.

Interaction





                            Respite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Acipra with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.
                    










Side Effects





                            In general, Acipra is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Acipra may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            US FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings








Symptomatic response to therapy with Acipra does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Acipra 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.


Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.


Proton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10–40%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.


A risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.


Patients should be cautioned that Acipra gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.


There have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.


Hepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.


No evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Acipra 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.


Co-administration of atazanavir with Acipra is not recommended.


Treatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.




Hypomagnesaemia
: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.
Influence on vitamin B12 absorption
: Acipra, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.
Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE)
: Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Acipra. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.
Interference with laboratory tests
: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Acipra 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Renal and hepatic impairment
: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
Pediatric populations
: Acipra is not recommended for use in children due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            The maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are  generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Acipra is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.

Pharmacology





                            Cetirizine Hydrochloride is a potent H1 receptor antagonist without any significant anticholinergic and antiserotonic effects. At pharmacologically active dose levels, it has almost no drowsiness effect and does not cause behavioral changes. It inhibits the histamine-mediated early phase of the allergic reaction and also reduces the migration of inflammatory cells and the release of mediators associated with the late phase of the allergic reaction.
Pharmacokinetics: Cetirizine 10 mg achieves peak plasma concentrations of 257 mcg/L within one hour of administration (980 mcg/L in children). Food does not affect the extent of absorption, but it may slightly reduce the rate. Peak blood levels 0.3 micrograms/ml are reached between thirty & sixty minutes after administration of 10 mg dose of Cetirizine. Its plasma half-life is approximately 11 hours. Absorption is very consistent from one subject to the next. Its renal clearance is 30 ml/minute and the excretion half-life is approximately nine hours.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Cetirizine oral dosage form
:




Adults and Children 6 years and older: 1 tablet or 2 teaspoonfuls daily (or 1 teaspoonful twice daily).


Children 2-6 years: 1 teaspoonful once daily or 1/2 teaspoonful twice daily.


Children 6 months to 2 years : 1/2 teaspoonful once daily. The dose in children 12-23 months of age can be increased to a maximum dose as 1/2 teaspoonful every 12 hours.




Cetirizine injectable dosage form
: Cetirizine is a single use injectable product for intravenous administration only. The recommended dosage regimen is once every 24 hours as needed for treatment of acute urticaria. Administer Cetirizine as an intravenous push over a period of 1 to 2 minutes. Cetirizine is not recommended in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age with impaired renal or hepatic function.




Adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older: The recommended dosage is 10 mg administered by intravenous injection.


Children 6 to 11 years of age: The recommended dosage is 5 mg or 10 mg depending on symptom severity administered by intravenous injection.


Children 6 months to 5 years of age: The recommended dosage is 2.5 mg administered by intravenous injection.

                            No clinically significant drug interactions have been found with Theophylline, Azithromycin, Pseudoephedrine, Ketoconazole or Erythromycin and with other drugs.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to Cetirizine or hydroxyzine.
                    










Side Effects





                            The most common side effects that occurred more frequently on Acitrin is somnolence.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            US FDA Pregnancy Category of Cetirizine Hydrochloride is B. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Cetirizine Hydrochloride has been shown to be excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cetirizine Hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Caution should be exercised when driving a car or operating a heavy machinery.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Hepatic or renal insufficiency
: In patients with mild to moderate hepatic and renal impairment, total body clearance of Acitrin is reduced and AUC and half-life increased by about 2 to 3 fold. Clearance is reduced in proportion to the decline in creatinine clearance. Plasma levels are unaffected by hemodialysis. The plasma elimination half-life in dialysis patients is approximately 20 hours and the plasma AUC is increased by about threefold.
Pediatric Use
: The safety of Acitrin has been demonstrated in pediatric patients aged 6 months to 5 years.
Elderly use
: The clearance of Acitrin is reduced in elderly patients, but only in proportion to the decrease in creatinine clearance.

Use in Special Populations






Hepatic or renal insufficiency
: In patients with mild to moderate hepatic and renal impairment, total body clearance of Acitrin is reduced and AUC and half-life increased by about 2 to 3 fold. Clearance is reduced in proportion to the decline in creatinine clearance. Plasma levels are unaffected by hemodialysis. The plasma elimination half-life in dialysis patients is approximately 20 hours and the plasma AUC is increased by about threefold.
Pediatric Use
: The safety of Acitrin has been demonstrated in pediatric patients aged 6 months to 5 years.
Elderly use
: The clearance of Acitrin is reduced in elderly patients, but only in proportion to the decrease in creatinine clearance.

Indications





                            Acitrin is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with seasonal & perennial allergic rhinitis. It is also indicated for the treatment of the uncomplicated skin manifestations of chronic idiopathic urticaria and allergen induced asthma.

Pharmacology





                            Cetirizine Hydrochloride is a potent H1 receptor antagonist without any significant anticholinergic and antiserotonic effects. At pharmacologically active dose levels, it has almost no drowsiness effect and does not cause behavioral changes. It inhibits the histamine-mediated early phase of the allergic reaction and also reduces the migration of inflammatory cells and the release of mediators associated with the late phase of the allergic reaction.
Pharmacokinetics: Cetirizine 10 mg achieves peak plasma concentrations of 257 mcg/L within one hour of administration (980 mcg/L in children). Food does not affect the extent of absorption, but it may slightly reduce the rate. Peak blood levels 0.3 micrograms/ml are reached between thirty & sixty minutes after administration of 10 mg dose of Cetirizine. Its plasma half-life is approximately 11 hours. Absorption is very consistent from one subject to the next. Its renal clearance is 30 ml/minute and the excretion half-life is approximately nine hours.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Cetirizine oral dosage form
:




Adults and Children 6 years and older: 1 tablet or 2 teaspoonfuls daily (or 1 teaspoonful twice daily).


Children 2-6 years: 1 teaspoonful once daily or 1/2 teaspoonful twice daily.


Children 6 months to 2 years : 1/2 teaspoonful once daily. The dose in children 12-23 months of age can be increased to a maximum dose as 1/2 teaspoonful every 12 hours.




Cetirizine injectable dosage form
: Cetirizine is a single use injectable product for intravenous administration only. The recommended dosage regimen is once every 24 hours as needed for treatment of acute urticaria. Administer Cetirizine as an intravenous push over a period of 1 to 2 minutes. Cetirizine is not recommended in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age with impaired renal or hepatic function.




Adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older: The recommended dosage is 10 mg administered by intravenous injection.


Children 6 to 11 years of age: The recommended dosage is 5 mg or 10 mg depending on symptom severity administered by intravenous injection.


Children 6 months to 5 years of age: The recommended dosage is 2.5 mg administered by intravenous injection.

                            This preparation contains Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride. Levocetirizine is the active (Levo) isomer of cetirizine. It is a new highly effective and well-tolerated nonsedating antihistamine with potent antiallergic properties. It has a two-fold higher affinity for H1 receptors than cetirizine. Levocetirizine has a rapid and long-acting action, allowing once-a-day administration.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adult and children 12 years of age and older
: The recommended dose is 5 mg once daily.
Children 6 to 11 years of age
: The recommended dose is 2.5 mg (½ tablet or 1 teaspoon oral solution) once daily.
Children 6 months to 5 years of age
: The recommended dose is 1.25 mg (½ teaspoon oral solution) once daily.
Pediatric use
: The recommended dose for the treatment of the uncomplicated skin manifestations of chronic idiopathic urticaria in patients 6 months to 17 years of age is based on extrapolation of efficacy from adults 18 years of age and older.
Geriatric use
: In clinical studies, each approved indication did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients.
Hepatic impairment
: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with solely hepatic impairment.
Renal impairment
:




Mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance: 50-80 ml/min): a dose of 2.5 mg once daily is recommended.


Moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance: 30-50 ml/min): a dose of 2.5 mg once every other day is recommended.


Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance: 10-30 ml/min): a dose of 2.5 mg twice weekly (administered once every 3-4 days) is recommended.


End-stage renal disease patients (creatinine clearance: <10 ml/min) and patients undergoing hemodialysis: should not receive Levocetirizine.

Pharmacology





                            Zoledronic Acid is a bisphosphonate and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralized bone. Intravenously administered Zoledronic Acid rapidly partitions to bone and localizes preferentially at sites of high bone turnover. The main molecular target of Zoledronic Acid in the osteoclast is the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. The relatively long duration of action of Zoledronic Acid is attributable to its high binding affinity to bone mineral.
                    
























Dosage






Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women
: The recommended regimen is a 5 mg infusion once a year given intravenously over no less than 15 minutes.
Prevention of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women
: The recommended regimen is a 5 mg infusion given once every 2 years intravenously over no less than 15 minutes.
Osteoporosis in Men
: The recommended regimen is a 5 mg infusion once a year given intravenously over no less than 15 minutes.
Treatment and Prevention of Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis
: The recommended regimen is a 5 mg infusion once a year given intravenously over no less than 15 minutes.
Treatment of Paget’s Disease of Bone
: The recommended dose is a 5 mg infusion. The infusion time must not be less than 15 minutes given over a constant infusion rate.
Re-treatment of Paget’s Disease
: Re-treatment with Zoledronic Acid may be considered in patients who have relapsed, based on increases in serum alkaline phosphatase, or in those patients who failed to achieve normalization of their serum alkaline phosphatase, or in those patients with symptoms, as dictated by medical practice.
Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation
: Instruct patients being treated for Paget’s disease of bone on the importance of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in maintaining serum calcium levels, and on the symptoms of hypocalcemia. All patients should take 1500 mg elemental calcium daily in divided doses (750 mg two times a day, or 500 mg three times a day) and 800 international units vitamin D daily, particularly in the 2 weeks following Zoledronic Acid administration.
Instruct patients being treated for osteoporosis to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if their dietary intake is inadequate. An average of at least 1200 mg calcium and 800-1000 international units vitamin D daily is recommended.

Pharmacology





                            Adapalene acts on retinoid receptors that are commonly found in the skin of face, back and chest. Biochemical and pharmacological studies have demonstrated that Adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization, and inflammatory processes, all of that represent important features in the pathology of acne vulgaris. Adapalene binds with specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors that normalize the differentiation of follicular epithelial cells resulting in decreased microcomedone formation. Absorption of Adapalene through human skin is low.
                    
























Dosage






Adapalene 0.1%
: It should be applied to the affected areas of skin, once daily at night-time.
Adapalene 0.3%
: It should be applied to the entire face and any other affected areas of the skin, once daily in the evening.
Children below 12 years of age
: Safety and effectiveness in children below 12 years of age have not been established.

Interaction





                            Concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime) should be approached with caution. Exercise particular caution in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol or salicylic acid in combination with Aclene. If any of these preparations have been used, it is advisable not to start therapy with Aclene until the effects of such preparations in skin have subsided. If combined use of both medications is important, it is better to use in two different times.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Adapalene should not be administered to individuals who are hypersensitive to Adapalene or any of its components.
                    










Side Effects





                            Erythema, scaling, dryness, pruritus, burning sensation, skin irritation, stinging unburn, acne flares, etc. are commonly seen during the first month of therapy but usually lessen with continued use of the medication.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Use Adapalene during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in breast milk. Exercise caution when administering Adapalene to a nursing mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Aclene should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Topical retinoid and related preparations
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Store in a cool (below 25°C) and dry place protected from light and moisture. Keep out of the reach of children. Keep the tube tightly closed after use.

Interaction





                            Concomitant topical acne therapy should be used with caution because a possible cumulative irritancy effect may occur, especially with the use of peeling, desquamating, or abrasive agents. No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Should not be administered to individuals who are hypersensitive to any of its component.
                    










Side Effects





                            Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/ burning may occur. Most commonly reported adverse events are dry skin, contact dermatitis, application site burning, application site irritation, and skin irritation.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            There are no well-controlled trials in pregnant women treated with Adapalene and Benzoyl peroxide. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination gel or Benzoyl peroxide. Furthermore, such studies are not always predictive of human response; therefore, this preparation should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. It is not known whether Adapalene or Benzoyl peroxide is excreted in human milk following use. Caution should be exercised when administered to a nursing woman.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen when sun exposure cannot be avoided.

Pharmacology






Aclidinium bromide
: Aclidinium bromide is a long-acting anti-muscarinic agent, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M3 receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical, in vitro as well as in vivo studies, prevention of acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The bronchodilation following inhalation of aclidinium bromide is predominantly a site-specific effect.
Formoterol fumarate
: Formoterol fumarate is a long-acting selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA) (beta 2-agonist). Inhaled formoterol fumarate acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. The pharmacologic effects of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including formoterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            For oral inhalation only. Should be taken by inhaler device. 400 mcg/12 meg, twice daily (One inhalation capsule in the morning and one in the evening ). Do not take more than one inhalation twice daily.

Interaction





                            Use of other adrenergic by any route may potentiate the effect of Aclitol. Use with caution.




Xanthine derivatives, steroids, diuretics or non-potassium sparing diuretics may potentiate hypokalemia or ECG changes. Use with caution.


Diuretics: Electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with non-potassium sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta2-agonists. Use with caution.


Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants: Use with extreme caution. May potentiate effect of formoterol fumarate on cardiovascular system.


Beta-blockers: Use with caution and only when medically necessary.


Anticholinergics: May interact additively with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Avoid administrations of Aclitol with other anticholinergic-containing drugs.
























Contraindications








Use of a long-acting beta 2-adrenergic agonist (LABA), including formoterol fumarate, one of the active ingredients in this combination, without an inhaled corticosteroid is contraindicated in patients with asthma.


Hypersensitivity to aclidinium bromide or formoterol fumarate or to any component of this product.














Side Effects





                            Most common adverse reactions (incidence 3% and more common than with placebo) include: upper respiratory tract infection and headache.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Aclitol or its individual components, formoterol fumarate or aclidinium bromide, in pregnant women to inform drug-associated risks. There are no available data on the effects of aclidinium bromide, or formoterol fumarate on the breastfed child or on milk production or presence in human milk.
                    








Precautions & Warnings








Asthma-related death: Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists as monotherapy (without an inhaled corticosteroid) for asthma increase the risk of serious asthma-related events.


Do not initiate in acutely deteriorating COPD or to treat acute symptoms.


Do not use in combination with additional medicine containing a LABA because of risk of overdose.


If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue Aclitol and institute alternative therapy.


Use with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis, diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.


Be alert to hypokalemia and hyperglycemia.


Use with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and instruct patients to contact a physician immediately if symptoms occur.


Worsening urinary retention may occur. Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if symptoms occur.

Interaction





                            The CNS depressant effects of Meclizine can be potentiated by concurrent use of Ethanol or other CNS depressant agents such as Benzodiazepines, Barbiturates, Tricyclic antidepressants, opiate agonists, skeletal muscle relaxants and antihistamines. Concurrent use of other anticholinergics can potentiate the anticholinergic effects of Meclizine. Meclizine can increase the absorption of digoxin by decreasing gastrointestinal motility.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Meclizine Hydrochloride and Pyridoxine Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to these ingredients.
                    










Side Effects





                            Drowsiness, dry mouth and, on rare occasions, blurred vision have been reported.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy Category B. Large-scale human studies have not demonstrated adverse fetal effects. It has been suggested that based on available data, Meclizine presents the lowest risk of teratogenicity and is the drug of first choice in treating nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. Safety for use in the nursing mother has not been established.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Patients should be warned that Meclizine Hydrochloride may impair their ability to perform hazardous activities requiring mental alertness or physical coordination (e.g., operating machinery, driving a motor vehicle). Patients should avoid alcoholic beverages while taking Acliz Plus. Due to its potential anticholinergic action, Acliz Plus should be used with caution in patients with asthma, glaucoma or enlargement of the prostate gland.

Pharmacology





                            Clobetasol Propionate is a very potent topical corticosteroid. It has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. It shows anti-inflammatory activity via multiple mechanisms to inhibit late phase allergic reactions. It decreases the density of mast cells, chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils. It also reduces cytokine production and inhibits the metabolism of arachidonic acid.
                    
























Dosage






Cream, Ointment: 
Adults, elderly and children over 1 year: Apply a thin layer of Clobetasol Propionate Cream or Ointment to the affected skin areas twice daily and rub in gently and completely. Repeated short courses of Clobetasol Propionate may be used to control exacerbations. In more resistant lesions, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the effect of Clobetasol can be enhanced, if necessary, by occluding the treatment area with polythene film. Overnight occlusion only is usually adequate to bring about a satisfactory response. 
Clobetasol Propionate is super-high potency topical corticosteroids; therefore, treatment should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks. The maximum weekly dose should not be exceeded 50 gm/week. In case of children, courses should be limited if possible to five days and reviewed weekly.
Spray
: Apply required quantity of spray of once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers. Therapy should be discontinued if no response is noted after one week or as soon as the lesion heals. It is advisable to use Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution for brief periods only.
Shampoo
: It should be applied to the dry (not wet) scalp once a day to the affected areas only. It should be massaged gently into the lesions and left in place for 15 minutes before lathering and rinsing. Treatment should be limited to 4 consecutive weeks. Total dosage of shampoo should not exceed 50 g per week. Under 18 years this preparation is not recommended.
Scalp Solution
: Apply required quantity of spray of Clobetasol Scalp Solution once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Scalp Solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers. Therapy should be discontinued if no response is noted after one week or as soon as the lesion heals. It is advisable to use Clobetasol Scalp Solution for brief periods only.

Interaction





                            Co-administered drugs that can inhibit CYP3A4 (eg ritonavir, itraconazole) have been shown to inhibit the metabolism of corticosteroids leading to increased systemic exposure.
                    




















Contraindications








Rosacea, acne vulgaris and perioral dermatitis. Primary cutaneous viral infections (e.g. herpes simplex, chickenpox).


Hypersensitivity to the preparation.


The use of Clobetasol Propionate skin preparations is not indicated in the treatment of primarily infected skin lesions caused by infection with fungi (e.g. candidiasis, tinea), or bacteria (e.g.impetigo): perianal and genital pruritus.


Dermatoses in children under one year of age, including dermatitis and napkin eruptions.














Side Effects








As with other topical corticosteroids prolonged use of large amounts, or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercorticism.


Prolonged and intensive treatment with a highly active corticosteroid preparation may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used or when skin folds are involved.


In rare instances, treatment of psoriasis with corticosteroids (or its withdrawal) is thought to have provoked the pustular form of the disease.


There are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids. Aclobet is usually well tolerated, but if signs of hypersensitivity appear, application should be stopped immediately. Exacerbation of symptoms may occur.














Pregnancy & Lactation





                            There are limited data from the use of Clobetasol Propionate cream in pregnant women. Topical administration of corticosteroids to pregnant animals can cause abnormalities of foetal development. The relevance of this finding to humans has not been established. However, the administration of Clobetasol Propionate Cream during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the possible risks of treatment.
It is unknown whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Clobetasol Propionate Cream is administered to a nursing woman.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Long-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If used in childhood or on the face, courses should be limited if possible to five days and occlusion should not be used.
The face, more than other areas of the body, may exhibit atrophic changes after prolonged treatment with potent topical corticosteroids. This must be borne in mind when treating such conditions as psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus and severe eczema.
If applied to the eye lids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma or cataract might result.
Topical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapses, development of tolerance, risk of generalised pustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important.
Appropriate anti-microbial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of anti-microbial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressings, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied.
                    








Use in Special Populations





                            In infants and children under 12 years of age, long-term continuous topical corticosteroid therapy should be avoided where possible, as adrenal suppression can occur. Children are more susceptible to the use of topical corticosteroids which develops atrophic changes.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Acute overdosage is very unlikely to occur, however, in the case of chronic over-dosage or misuse the features of hypercortisolism may occur and in this situation topical steroid should be discontinued.

Pharmacology





                            Clobetasol Propionate is a very potent corticosteroid. It is prescribed to treat severe inflammatory skin disorders such as eczema and psoriasis that have not responded to weaker corticosteroids. Neomycin Sulphate is an antibiotic of the aminoglycoside type and is used to treat infections with bacteria. Nystatin is an antifungal that kills fungi and yeasts by interfering with their cell membranes. The mechanism of the topical steroids like Clobetasol, in general, is unclear. However, Clobetasol Propionate is highly active corticosteroid with topical anti-inflammatory activity. The major effect of Clobetasol Propionate on skin is a nonspecific anti-inflammatory response, partially due to vasoconstriction and decrease in collagen synthesis. Neomycin binds to the ribosomal 30s and 50s sub-units of susceptible bacteria and inhibits protein synthesis. Neomycin also causes a misreading of the genetic codes of the mRNA template and this causes incorrect amino acids to be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain. Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of the fungus with a resultant change in membrane permeability allowing leakage of intracellular components.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adults
: Apply sparingly to the affected area once or twice daily until improvement occurs. In very resistant lesion, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the anti-inflammatory effect of this preparation can be enhanced (if necessary) by occluding the treatment area with polythene. Treatment should not be continued for more than 7 days without medical supervision. If a longer course is necessary, it is recommended that treatment should not be continued for more than 4 weeks without the patient's condition being reviewed.
Elderly
: This preparation is suitable for use in elderly. Caution should be exercised in cases where a decrease in renal function exists and significant systemic absorption of Neomycin Sulphate may occur.
Children
: This preparation is suitable for use in children (2 years and over) at the same dose as adults. A possibility of increased absorption exists in very young children, thus this cream/ointment is not recommended for use in neonates and infants (younger than 2 years).

'




















Interaction





                            Neomycin Sulphate can intensify and prolong the respiratory depressant effects of neuromuscular blocking agents following significant systemic absorption. However, if used in accordance with the recommendations, systemic exposure to Neomycin Sulphate is expected to be minimal and drug interactions are unlikely to be significant. No hazardous interactions have been reported with use of Clobetasol Propionate or Nystatin.
                    




















Contraindications





                            This medication is contraindicated in rosacea, acne vulgaris and perioral dermatitis, primary cutaneous viral infection (eg-Herpes simplex, chicken pox) and hypersensitivity to the preparation.
                    










Side Effects





                            As with other topical corticosteroids, prolonged use of large amount or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercortisolism. The effect is more likely to occur in infants and children and if occlusive dressings are used. Prolonged and intensive treatment with highly active corticosteroid preparations may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae, and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used, or when skin folds are involved. There are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            There is little information to demonstrate the possible effect of topically applied Neomycin in pregnancy and lactation. However, Neomycin present in the maternal blood can cross the placenta and may give rise to a theoretical risk of foetal toxicity, thus the use of the preparation is not recommended in pregnancy and lactation. The safety of Clobetasol Propionate has not been established in lactating mothers.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Long-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If applied to the eyelids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma might result. If this medication does enter the eye, the affected eye should be thoroughly washed with copious amount of water.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Acute overdosage is very unlikely to occur. No overdose-related problem yet reported. However, in the case of chronic overdosage or misuse, the features of hypercortisolism may appear and in this situation, topical steroids should be discontinued gradually.

Acme's Acme's Dextrose is administered in the treatment of carbohydrate and fluid depletions. It is mainly used to replace water deficiency and should be given alone when there is no significant loss of electrolytes. Water depletion (dehydration) tends to occur when these losses are not matched by a comparable intake, as for example may occur in coma or dysphagia or in the aged person who may not drink water in sufficient amount on their own initiative. It provides a readily metabolizable nutrient. One litre of 5% solution provides about 170 calories. Glucose solutions are also given in regimens with calcium bicarbonate, and insulin for the emergency management of hyperkalaemia. They are also given, after correction of hyperglycaemia, during treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis, when they must be accompanied by continuing insulin infusion. Acme's Acme's Dextrose also may act as a suitable vehicle for the slow intravenous infusion of numerous drugs.

Pharmacology





                            Dextrose is a form of glucose (sugar). Dextrose 5% in water is injected into a vein through an IV to replace lost fluids and provide carbohydrates to the body. Dextrose 5% in water is used to treat low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), insulin shock, or dehydration (fluid loss). Dextrose 5% in water is also given for nutritional support to patients who are unable to eat because of illness, injury, or other medical condition.
                    
























Dosage






5% dextrose solution
: The dose of Dextrose infusion is variable. It is dependent on individual patient requirements. For 5% dextrose solution, the dose frequently ranges from 500 to 1000 ml. The maximum rate of infusion that will not cause glycosuria is 0.5 g/kg/hour. About 95% is retained when the rate is 0.8 g/kg/hr. the maximum rate of glucose utilization is about 800 mg per kg body weight per hour.
10% dextrose solution
: Dose is variable. It depends on the clinical condition, age and body surface area of the patients and the judgment of the physician. Ordinarily, normal circulation is restored by infusing 20-30 ml/kg as rapidly as possible. The laboratory findings should be available by this time so that the physician can proceed more slowly with logically planned subsequent fluid therapy. 
25% dextrose solution
: The volume and rate of infusion of dextrose solution will depend upon the requirements of the individual patient and the judgment of the physician. The maximum rate at which dextrose can be infused without producing glycosuria is 0.5 g/kg/hr. The usual recommended flow rate for adult is 10-35 drops per minute infused intravenously. It should not be administered by SC or IM route. 25% dextrose solution should be infused through the largest available peripheral vein.
Oral powder
:




Adult: 10-20 gm as single dose; may repeat in 10 min if needed.


Child: >2 yr: 10-20 gm as single dose; may repeat in 10 min if needed.

Pharmacology





                            Ampicillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to 1 or more of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) which in turn inhibit the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell walls. Bacteria eventually lyse due to ongoing activity of cell wall autolytic enzymes (autolysins and murein hydrolases) while cell wall assembly is arrested.
                    
























Dosage






Intra-articular:
Supplement in systemic therapy for treatment of susceptible infections-

Interaction





                            May reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives. May alter INR while on warfarin and phenindione. May reduce the efficacy of oral typhoid vaccines. May reduce the excretion of methotrexate. Reduced excretion with probenecid and sulfinpyrazone, resulting to increased risk of toxicity. Allopurinol increases ampicillin-induced skin reactions. Reduced absorption with chloroquine. Bacteriostatic antibacterials (e.g. erythromycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline) may interfere with the bactericidal action of ampicillin.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Hypersensitivity to ampicillin and other penicillins.
                    










Side Effects





                            Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, erythematous maculo-papular rashes, sore mouth, black/hairy tongue, rash, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema, fever, joint pains, serum sickness-like symptoms, haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, neutropenia, coagulation disorders, prolonged bleeding time and prothrombin time, CNS toxicity (e.g. convulsions); paraesthesia, nephropathy, interstitial nephritis, hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, moderate and transient increase in transaminases, Anaphylaxis, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD).
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy Category B. Either animal-reproduction studies have not demonstrated a fetal risk but there are no controlled studies in pregnant women or animal-reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect (other than a decrease in fertility) that was not confirmed in controlled studies in women in the 1st trimester (and there is no evidence of a risk in later trimesters).
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Patient with history of β-lactam allergy. During renal impairment, Pregnancy and lactation.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Renal Impairment
: CrCl<10: Dose reduction or increase in dose interval.
                    








Overdose Effects






Symptoms
: Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. 
Management
: Symptomatic and supportive treatment. May be removed from the circulation by haemodialysis.
                    








Reconstitution






Intramuscular
: Add 1.5 mL water for inj to 500 mg vial contents.

Pharmacology





                            Ampicillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to 1 or more of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) which in turn inhibit the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell walls. Bacteria eventually lyse due to ongoing activity of cell wall autolytic enzymes (autolysins and murein hydrolases) while cell wall assembly is arrested.

Indications





                            Treatment of men with erectile dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. In order for Acmegra to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. Acmegra is also indicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Description





                            Acmegra is a selective, reversible inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). When sexual stimulation causes the local release of nitric oxide; inhibition of PDE5 by Acmegra produces increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This results in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood into the penile tissues, thereby producing an erection. Acmegra has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.
                    




















Pharmacology






Mechanism of Action
: The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.
Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism
: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, Sildenafil. Both Sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours.
Absorption and Distribution
: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When Sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced.
Metabolism and Excretion
: Sildenafil is cleared by hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. After either oral or intravenous administration, Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose).
Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations
: Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of Sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of Sildenafil compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Erectile dysfunction
: For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Sildenafil may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day.
The following factors are associated with increased plasma levels of Sildenafil
: age >65, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir). Since higher plasma levels may increase both the efficacy and incidence of adverse events, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in these patients. Sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated. When Sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alphablocker therapy prior to initiating Sildenafil treatment and Sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension
: The recommended dose of sildenafil citrate is 20 mg three times a day and should be taken approximately 4-6 hours apart, with or without food.

Interaction





                            Acmegra metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major route) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes 15 may reduce Acmegra clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase Acmegra clearance. Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma Acmegra concentrations when coadministered with Acmegra (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of Acmegra was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in Acmegra systemic exposure (AUC). In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Acmegra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Acmegra Cmax and a 210% increase in Acmegra AUC. Acmegra had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Acmegra clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Acmegra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Acmegra Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Acmegra plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Acmegra were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Acmegra was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Acmegra had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Acmegra has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Acmegra levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Acmegra at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Acmegra AUC and a 55% decrease in Acmegra Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Acmegra. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Acmegra. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Acmegra pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Acmegra, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Sildenafil is contraindicated in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Sildenafil potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitrates, so it is contraindicated in patients who are using organic nitrates, either regularly or intermittently.

Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy category B. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Sildenafil in pregnant women. Sildenafil is not indicated for use by women. In animal study shows that Sildenafil has no evidence of teratogenicity or embryotoxicity.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment.
Before prescribing Acmegra, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Acmegra, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting).
Consideration should be given to the following:




Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors.


In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose.


In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. A stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor.


Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs.


Acmegra has systemic vasodilatory properties and may augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of other anti-hypertensive medications.


Patients on multiple antihypertensive medications were included in the pivotal clinical trials for Acmegra. In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and Acmegra, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted.


The safety of Acmegra is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration.


Acmegra should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia).


The safety and efficacy of combinations of Acmegra with other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended.



There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Acmegra, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Acmegra has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Acmegra, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity.
Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Acmegra - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure.
There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Acmegra in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution.




Patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months;


Patients with resting hypotension (BP <90/50) or hypertension (BP >170/110);


Patients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina;


Patients with retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases);


Patients with sickle cell or related anemias.



Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Acmegra. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Acmegra is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Acmegra are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Acmegra exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Acmegra (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Acmegra dosage is recommended.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            In studies with healthy volunteers of single doses up to 800 mg, adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses but incidence rates and severities were increased. 24 In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Renal dialysis is not expected to accelerate clearance as Acmegra is highly bound to plasma proteins and it is not eliminated in the urine.

Description





                            Acmegra is a selective, reversible inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). When sexual stimulation causes the local release of nitric oxide; inhibition of PDE5 by Acmegra produces increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This results in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood into the penile tissues, thereby producing an erection. Acmegra has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.
                    




















Pharmacology






Mechanism of Action
: The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.
Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism
: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, Sildenafil. Both Sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours.
Absorption and Distribution
: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When Sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced.
Metabolism and Excretion
: Sildenafil is cleared by hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. After either oral or intravenous administration, Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose).
Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations
: Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of Sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of Sildenafil compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Erectile dysfunction
: For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Sildenafil may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day.
The following factors are associated with increased plasma levels of Sildenafil
: age >65, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir). Since higher plasma levels may increase both the efficacy and incidence of adverse events, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in these patients. Sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated. When Sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alphablocker therapy prior to initiating Sildenafil treatment and Sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension
: The recommended dose of sildenafil citrate is 20 mg three times a day and should be taken approximately 4-6 hours apart, with or without food.

Interaction





                            Acmegra metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major route) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes 15 may reduce Acmegra clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase Acmegra clearance. Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma Acmegra concentrations when coadministered with Acmegra (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of Acmegra was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in Acmegra systemic exposure (AUC). In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Acmegra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Acmegra Cmax and a 210% increase in Acmegra AUC. Acmegra had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Acmegra clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Acmegra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Acmegra Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Acmegra plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Acmegra were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Acmegra was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Acmegra had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Acmegra has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Acmegra levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Acmegra at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Acmegra AUC and a 55% decrease in Acmegra Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Acmegra. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Acmegra. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Acmegra pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Acmegra, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Sildenafil is contraindicated in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Sildenafil potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitrates, so it is contraindicated in patients who are using organic nitrates, either regularly or intermittently.

Description





                            Acmegra is a selective, reversible inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). When sexual stimulation causes the local release of nitric oxide; inhibition of PDE5 by Acmegra produces increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This results in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood into the penile tissues, thereby producing an erection. Acmegra has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.
                    




















Pharmacology






Mechanism of Action
: The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.
Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism
: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, Sildenafil. Both Sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours.
Absorption and Distribution
: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When Sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced.
Metabolism and Excretion
: Sildenafil is cleared by hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. After either oral or intravenous administration, Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose).
Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations
: Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of Sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of Sildenafil compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Erectile dysfunction
: For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Sildenafil may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day.
The following factors are associated with increased plasma levels of Sildenafil
: age >65, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir). Since higher plasma levels may increase both the efficacy and incidence of adverse events, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in these patients. Sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated. When Sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alphablocker therapy prior to initiating Sildenafil treatment and Sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension
: The recommended dose of sildenafil citrate is 20 mg three times a day and should be taken approximately 4-6 hours apart, with or without food.

Interaction





                            Acmegra metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major route) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes 15 may reduce Acmegra clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase Acmegra clearance. Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma Acmegra concentrations when coadministered with Acmegra (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of Acmegra was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in Acmegra systemic exposure (AUC). In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Acmegra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Acmegra Cmax and a 210% increase in Acmegra AUC. Acmegra had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Acmegra clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Acmegra (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Acmegra Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Acmegra plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Acmegra were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Acmegra was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Acmegra had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Acmegra has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Acmegra levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Acmegra at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Acmegra AUC and a 55% decrease in Acmegra Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Acmegra. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Acmegra. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Acmegra pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Acmegra, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Sildenafil is contraindicated in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Sildenafil potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitrates, so it is contraindicated in patients who are using organic nitrates, either regularly or intermittently.

Precautions & Warnings





                            General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment.
Before prescribing Acmegra, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Acmegra, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting).
Consideration should be given to the following:




Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors.


In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose.


In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. A stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor.


Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs.


Acmegra has systemic vasodilatory properties and may augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of other anti-hypertensive medications.


Patients on multiple antihypertensive medications were included in the pivotal clinical trials for Acmegra. In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and Acmegra, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted.


The safety of Acmegra is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration.


Acmegra should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia).


The safety and efficacy of combinations of Acmegra with other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended.



There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Acmegra, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Acmegra has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Acmegra, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity.
Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Acmegra - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure.
There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Acmegra in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution.




Patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months;


Patients with resting hypotension (BP <90/50) or hypertension (BP >170/110);


Patients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina;


Patients with retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases);


Patients with sickle cell or related anemias.



Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Acmegra. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Acmegra is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Acmegra are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Acmegra exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Acmegra (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Acmegra dosage is recommended.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            In studies with healthy volunteers of single doses up to 800 mg, adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses but incidence rates and severities were increased. 24 In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Renal dialysis is not expected to accelerate clearance as Acmegra is highly bound to plasma proteins and it is not eliminated in the urine.

Pharmacology





                            Adapalene & Benzoyl peroxide gel is indicated for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris in patients 12 years of age and older. Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that Adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. Adapalene binds with specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors that normalize the differentiation of follicular epithelial cells resulting in decreased microcomedone formation. Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bacteriocidal and keratolytic effects.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            Apply a thin film of Adapalene & Benzoyl peroxide gel to affected areas of the face and/or trunk once daily after washing. Use a pea-sized amount for each area of the face (e.g., forehead, chin, each cheek). Avoid the eyes, lips and mucous membranes. Adapalene & Benzoyl peroxide is not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.
Pediatric use
: The safety and effectiveness of Adapalene and Benzoyl peroxide gel in pediatric patients under the age of 12 years have not been established.

Interaction





                            Concomitant topical acne therapy should be used with caution because a possible cumulative irritancy effect may occur, especially with the use of peeling, desquamating, or abrasive agents. No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Should not be administered to individuals who are hypersensitive to any of its component.
                    










Side Effects





                            Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/ burning may occur. Most commonly reported adverse events are dry skin, contact dermatitis, application site burning, application site irritation, and skin irritation.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            There are no well-controlled trials in pregnant women treated with Adapalene and Benzoyl peroxide. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination gel or Benzoyl peroxide. Furthermore, such studies are not always predictive of human response; therefore, this preparation should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. It is not known whether Adapalene or Benzoyl peroxide is excreted in human milk following use. Caution should be exercised when administered to a nursing woman.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen when sun exposure cannot be avoided.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Topical retinoid and related preparations
                    








Storage Conditions

Pharmacology





                            Dapsone has both anti-infammatory and antimicrobial properties. A combination of these activities may account for its efcacy in acne. Anti-infammatory efects include inhibition of neutrophil myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase activity, suppression of hypochlorous acid production, scavenging of reactive oxygen species, suppression of neutrophil activity, and inhibition of chemoattractant-induced signal transduction. Antimicrobial activity, similar to that of sulfones and sulfonamides, is by inhibition of bacterial dihydropteroate synthase in the folic acid metabolic pathway. This mechanism is efective against microorganisms synthesizing their own folic acid. In vitro susceptibility testing has demonstrated some activity for Dapsone against Propionibacterium species, including Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes).
                    
























Dosage & Administration








Apply once daily (7.5% gel) and twice daily (5% gel) after the skin is gently washed and patted dry


Apply approximately a pea-sized amount of gel in a thin layer to the acne affected area


Rub the gel gently and completely


If there is no improvement after 12 weeks, treatment with this gel should be reassessed


Dapsone gel maybe gritty with visible drug substance particles


Wash hands after application

Interaction





                            Trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole (TMP/ SMX) increases the systemic level of Acnesone and its metabolites. Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as Acnesone may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Those who are hypersensitive to Dapsone.
                    










Side Effects





                            Oiliness/peeiing, dryness and erythema at the application site.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone Gel should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Although systemic absorption of dapsone following topical application Dapsone Gel is minimal relative to oral dapsone administration, it is known that dapsone is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for oral dapsone to cause adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue Dapsone Gel, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

Indications





                            Acora, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and a high risk of developing an atherothrombotic event.

Pharmacology





                            Ticagrelor is a P2Y
12
 receptor antagonist. The P2Y
12
 receptor couples with Gα
i2
 and other G
i
 proteins which inhibit adenylyl cyclase. G
i
 mediated signalling also activates PI3K, Akt, Rap1b, and potassium channels. The downstream effects of these activities mediate hemostasis and lead to platelet aggregation. Antagonism of the P2Y
12
 receptor reduces development of occlusive thromboses, which can reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            Patients taking Ticagrelor should also take a daily low maintenance dose of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 75-150 mg unless specifically contraindicated. 
Acute coronary syndromes
: Ticagrelor treatment should be initiated with a single 180 mg loading dose (two tablets of 90 mg) and then continued at 90 mg twice daily. Treatment with Ticagrelor twice daily is recommended for 12 months in ACS patients unless discontinuation is clinically indicated. 
History of myocardial infarction
: Ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily is the recommended dose when an extended treatment is required for patients with a history of MI of at least one year and a high risk of an atherothrombotic event. Treatment may be started without interruption as continuation therapy after the initial one-year treatment with ticagrelor or another adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor inhibitor therapy in ACS patients with a high risk of an atherothrombotic event. Treatment can also be initiated up to 2 years from the MI, or within one year after stopping previous ADP receptor inhibitor treatment. There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor beyond 3 years of extended treatment. 
Switch therapy
: If a switch is needed, the first dose of ticagrelor should be administered 24 hours following the last dose of the other antiplatelet medication. 
Missed dose
: A patient who misses a dose of ticagrelor should take only one tablet (their next dose) at its scheduled time. 
Elderly
: No dose adjustment is required in the elderly. 
Renal impairment
: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. No information is available concerning the treatment of patients on renal dialysis and therefore ticagrelor is not recommended in these patients. 
Hepatic impairment
: Ticagrelor has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and its use in these patients is therefore contraindicated. Only limited information is available in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Dose adjustment is not recommended, but ticagrelor should be used with caution. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. 
Pediatric population
: The safety and efficacy of ticagrelor in hildren below the age of 18 years have not been established. No data are available. Ticagrelor can be administered with or without food. Contra-indications, warnings etc.

Interaction





                            Effects of medicinal and other products on Acora; 
CYP3A4 inhibitors
: Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, and atazanavir) inhibitors with Acora is contraindicated. 
CYP3A inducers
: Co-administration of Acora with potent CYP3A inducers (rifampicin)may decrease exposure and efficacy of Acora, therefore, their concomitant use with Acora is discouraged. 
Cyclosporine (P-gp and CYP3A inhibitor)
: No data are available on concomitant use of Acora with other active substances that also are potent P-gp inhibitors and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, quinidine) that also may increase Acora exposure. If the association cannot be avoided, their concomitant use should be made with caution. 
Effects of Acora on other medicinal products
: Medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4: The concomitant use of Acora with doses of simvastatin or lovastatin greater than 40 mg is not recommended. Atorvastatin: Co-administration of atorvastatin and Acora increased atorvastatin acid Cmax by 23% and AUC by 36%. Similar increases in AUC and Cmax were observed for all atorvastatin acid metabolites. These increases are not considered clinically significant. Acora is a mild CYP3A4 inhibitor. Co-administration of Acora and CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices (i.e. cisapride or ergot alkaloids) is not recommended, as Acora may increase the exposure to this medicinal products. 
P-gp substrates (including digoxin, cyclosporine)
: Appropriate clinical and/or laboratory monitoring is recommended when giving narrow therapeutic index P-gp dependent medicinal products like digoxin concomitantly with Acora. 
Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C9
: Co-administration of Acora with tolbutamide resulted in no change in the plasma levels of either medicinal product, which suggests that Acora is not a CYP2C9 inhibitor and unlikely to alter the CYP2C9 mediated metabolism of medicinal products like warfarin and tolbutamide. 
Oral contraceptives
: No clinically relevant effect on oral contraceptive efficacy is expected when levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol is co-administered with Acora. 
Medicinal products known to induce bradycardia
: No evidence of clinically significant adverse reactions were observed in the PLATO trial after concomitant administration with one or more medicinal products known to induce bradycardia (e.g. 96% beta blockers, 33% calcium channel blockers diltiazem and verapamil, and 4% digoxin). 
Other concomitant therapy
: No evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions with these medicinal products (acetylsalicylic acid, proton pump inhibitors, statins, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) was observed. Due to potential pharmacodynamic interactions, caution should be exercised with the concomitant administration of Acora with medicinal products (heparin, enoxaparin or desmopressin) known to alter haemostasis. Due to reports of cutaneous bleeding abnormalities with SSRIs (e.g. paroxetine, sertraline and citalopram), caution is advised when administering SSRIs with Acora as this may increase the risk of bleeding.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients, active pathological bleeding, history of intracranial haemorrhage, severe hepatic impairment.
                    










Side Effects





                            Very Common: Blood disorder bleedings, Hyperuricaemia, Dyspnoea. Common: Gout/Gouty Arthritis, Dizziness, Syncope, Headache, Vertigo, Hypotension, Respiratory system bleedings, Gastrointestinal haemorrhage, Diarrhoea, Nausea, Dyspepsia, Constipation, Subcutaneous or dermal bleeding, Rash, Pruritus, Urinary tract bleeding, Blood creatinine increased, Postprocedural haemorrhage, Traumatic bleedings. Uncommon: Tumour bleedings, Hypersensitivity including angioedema, Confusion, Intracranial haemorrhage, Eye haemorrhage, Ear haemorrhage, Retroperitoneal haemorrhage, Muscular bleedings.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Ticagrelor is not recommended during pregnancy. Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of ticagrelor and its active metabolites in milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from ticagrelor therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.
                    








Precautions & Warnings






Bleeding risk
: The use of Acora in patients at known increased risk for bleeding should be balanced against the benefit in terms of prevention of atherothrombotic events. If clinically indicated, Acora should be used with caution in the following patient groups; Patients with a propensity to bleed (e.g. due to recent trauma, recent surgery, coagulation disorders, active or recent gastrointestinal bleeding). Antifibrinolytic therapy (aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid) and/or recombinant factor VIIa therapy may increase haemostasis. Acora may be resumed after the cause of bleeding has been identified and controlled.
Surgery
: Patients should be advised to inform  physicians and dentists that they are taking Acora before any surgery is scheduled and before any new medicinal product is taken. If a patient is to undergo elective surgery and the antiplatelet effect is not desired, Acora should be discontinued 5 days prior to surgery.
Patients with prior ischaemic stroke
: ACS patients with prior ischaemic stroke can be treated with Acora for up to 12 months. Patients at risk for bradycardic events: Due to the limited clinical experience, Acora should be used with caution in these patients.
Dyspnoea
: Patients with asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may have an increased absolute risk of experiencing dyspnoea with Acora. Acora should be used with caution in patients with a history of asthma and/or COPD. Creatinine elevations: Creatinine levels may increase during treatment with Acora. In patients with ACS, it is recommended that renal function is also checked one month after initiating the treatment with Acora, paying special attention to patients ≥75 years, patients with moderate/severe renal impairment and those receiving concomitant treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Uric acid increase: Hyperuricaemia may occur during treatment with Acora. Caution is advised in patients with a history of hyperuricaemia or gouty arthritis. Other: Based on a relationship observed in PLATO between maintenance dose of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and relative efficacy of Acora compared to clopidogrel, co-administration of Acora and high maintenance dose of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (>300 mg) is not recommended.
Premature discontinuation
: Premature discontinuation with any antiplatelet therapy, including Acora, could result in an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) death or MI due to the patient’s underlying disease. Therefore, premature discontinuation of treatment should be avoided.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Acora is well tolerated in single doses up to 900 mg. Gastrointestinal toxicity was dose-limiting in a single ascending dose study. Other clinically meaningful adverse reactions which may occur with overdose include dyspnoea and ventricular pauses.

Pharmacology





                            Ambroxol is the active metabolite of bromhexine and it has been proven that this metabolite possesses a greater bronchosecretolytic effect than bromhexine. It improves sputum rheology by hydrating mechanism leading to liquefaction of mucus in the lumen of respiratory tract, thus facilitating expectoration of mucus and reducing dyspnea. It stimulates production of phospholipids of surfactant by alveolar cells, thus contributing to the lowering of superficial tension in the alveoli. It also reduces bronchial hyperactivity. Ambroxol has anti inflammatory properties owing to the inhibitory effect on the production of cellular cytokines and arachidonic acid metabolites. In patients with COPD it traditionally improves airway patency.

Interaction





                            Acorex should not be taken simultaneously with antitussives (e.g.Codeine) because phlegm, which has been liquefied by Acorex might not be expectorated.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Ambroxol or Bromhexine.
                    










Side Effects





                            Gastrointestinal side effects like epigastric pain, stomach overfill feeling may occur occasionally. Rarely allergic responses such as eruption, urticaria or angioneurotic edema have been reported.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Teratogenic and fetal toxicity studies have shown no harmful effect of Ambroxol. However, it is advised not to use it in pregnancy, especially during the1st trimester. Safety during lactation has not been established yet.

Pharmacology





                            Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility.
Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.
Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:




Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms
: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes


Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms
: Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae


Other microorganisms
: Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Betalactamase production should have no effect on azithromycin activity.


Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms
: Streptococci (Groups C,F,G), Viridans group streptococci


Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms
: Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila


Anaerobic microorganisms
: Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella bivia




























Dosage






Oral
-
Adult
: 500 mg once daily orally for 3 days or 500 mg once on day 1, then 250 mg once on days 2-5 for 4 days. For sexually transmitted diseases caused by Chlamydia trachomatis in adults, the dose is 1 gm given as a single dose or 500 mg once on day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily for next 2 days may also be given.
Children
:




10 mg/kg body weight once daily for 3 days for child over 6 months


200 mg (1 teaspoonful) for 3 days if body weight is 15-25 kg


300 mg (1½ teaspoonfuls) for 3 days if body weight is 26-35 kg; 400 mg (2 teaspoonfuls) for 3 days if body weight is 36-45 kg.


In typhoid fever, 500 mg (2½ teaspoonfuls) once daily for 7-10 days is given.




Azithromycin Injection (For IV Infusion only)
: The recommended dose of Azithromycin for injection for the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia due to the indicated organisms is:




500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for at least two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by Azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 500 mg, administered as two 250-mg tablets to complete a 7 to 10-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response.


The recommended dose of Azithromycin for the treatment of adult patients with pelvic inflammatory disease due to the indicated organisms is: 500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for one or two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by Azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 250 mg to complete a 7-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response. If anaerobic microorganisms are suspected of contributing to the infection, an antimicrobial agent with anaerobic activity should be administered in combination with Azithromycin.


Safety and effectiveness of azithromycin for injection in children or adolescents under 16 years have not been established.

Interaction






Antacid
: In patients receiving azithromycin and antacids, azithromycin should be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the antacid. Carbamazepine: In a pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers, no significant effect was observed on the plasma levels of carbamazepine or its active metabolite. 
Cyclosporin
: Some of the related macrolide antibiotics interfere with the metabolism of cyclosporin. In the absence of conclusive data from pharmacokinetic studies or clinical data investigating potential interactions between azithromycin and cyclosporine, caution should be exercised before co-administration of these two drugs. If coadministrations is necessary, cyclosporin levels should be monitored and the dose adjusted accordingly. 
Digoxin
: Some of the macrolide antibiotics have been reported to impair the metabolism of digoxin (in the gut) in some patients. Therefore, in patients receiving concomitant azithromycin and digoxin the possibility of raised digoxin levels should be borne in mind and digoxin levels monitored. 
Ergot derivatives
: Because of the theoretical possibility of ergotism, azithromycin and ergot derivatives should not be co-administered. 
Methylprednisolone
: In a pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers, azithromycin had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of methylprednisolone. 
Theophylline
: There is no evidence of any pharmacokinetic interaction when azithromycin and theophylline are co-administered to healthy volunteers. In general, however, theophylline levels should be monitored. 
Warfarin
: In a pharmacodynamic interaction study, azithromycin did not alter the anticoagulant effect of a single 15 mg dose of warfarin administered to healthy volunteers. Acos and warfarin may be co-administered, but monitoring of the prothrombin time should be continued as routinely performed. 
Terfenadine
: Acos did not affect the pharmacokinetics of terfenadine administered at the recommended dose of 60 mg every 12 hours. Addition of azithromycin did not result in any significant changes in cardiac repolarisation (QTc interval) measured during the steady state dosing of terfenadine.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Azithromycin Dihydrate is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to Azithromycin or any other macrolide antibiotic. Co-administration of ergot derivatives and Azithromycin is contraindicated. Azithromycin is contraindicated in patients with hepatic diseases.
                    










Side Effects





                            Acos is well tolerated with a low incidence of side-effects. Most side-effects observed were mild to moderate in severity. The majority of side-effects were gastrointestinal in origin with nauseas, abdominal discomfort (pain/cramps), vomiting, flatulence, diarrhoea and loose stools being occasionally observed. Allergic reactions such as rash or photosensitivity have occurred and there have also been rare reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions. Reversible elevations in liver transaminases have been seen with a frequency similar to the comparative macrolides and penicillins used in clinical trials. Rarely, cases of cholestatic jaundice have been observed. Transient mild reductions in neutrofil counts have occasionally been observed in clinical trials, although a causal relationship to azithromycin has not been established. Hearing impairment: In investigational studies where higher doses were used for prolonged periods of time, reversible hearing impairment was seen in some patients.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy Category of Azithromycin Dihydrate is B. Animal reproduction studies have demonstrated that Azithromycin has no evidence of harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Since animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if adequate alternatives are not available. It is not known whether Azithromycin is secreted in breast milk. So, caution should be exercised when Azithromycin is administered to nursing women.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            As with erythromycin and other macrolides, rare serious allergic reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylaxis, has been reported. Some of these reactions with azithromycin have resulted in recurrent symptoms and required a long period of observation and treatment.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Use in renal impairment
: No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance >40 ml/min), but there are no data regarding azithromycin in patients with more severe renal impairment, thus caution should be exercised in using azithromycin in these patients.
Use in hepatic impairment
: As the liver is the principal route of excretion of azithromycin, it should not be used in patients with hepatic disease.
Effects on ability to drive and use machines
: There is no evidence to suggest that azithromycin may have an effect on a patient’s ability to drive or operate machinery.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            There is no data on overdosage with Acos. Typical symptoms of overdosage with macrolide antibiotics include hearing loss, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Gastric lavage and general supportive measures are indicated.
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Keep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.

Pharmacology





                            Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility.
Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.
Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:




Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms
: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes


Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms
: Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae


Other microorganisms
: Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Betalactamase production should have no effect on azithromycin activity.


Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms
: Streptococci (Groups C,F,G), Viridans group streptococci


Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms
: Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila


Anaerobic microorganisms
: Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella bivia




























Dosage






Oral
-
Adult
: 500 mg once daily orally for 3 days or 500 mg once on day 1, then 250 mg once on days 2-5 for 4 days. For sexually transmitted diseases caused by Chlamydia trachomatis in adults, the dose is 1 gm given as a single dose or 500 mg once on day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily for next 2 days may also be given.
Children
:




10 mg/kg body weight once daily for 3 days for child over 6 months


200 mg (1 teaspoonful) for 3 days if body weight is 15-25 kg


300 mg (1½ teaspoonfuls) for 3 days if body weight is 26-35 kg; 400 mg (2 teaspoonfuls) for 3 days if body weight is 36-45 kg.


In typhoid fever, 500 mg (2½ teaspoonfuls) once daily for 7-10 days is given.




Azithromycin Injection (For IV Infusion only)
: The recommended dose of Azithromycin for injection for the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia due to the indicated organisms is:




500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for at least two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by Azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 500 mg, administered as two 250-mg tablets to complete a 7 to 10-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response.


The recommended dose of Azithromycin for the treatment of adult patients with pelvic inflammatory disease due to the indicated organisms is: 500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for one or two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by Azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 250 mg to complete a 7-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response. If anaerobic microorganisms are suspected of contributing to the infection, an antimicrobial agent with anaerobic activity should be administered in combination with Azithromycin.


Safety and effectiveness of azithromycin for injection in children or adolescents under 16 years have not been established.

Interaction






Antacid
: In patients receiving azithromycin and antacids, azithromycin should be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the antacid. Carbamazepine: In a pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers, no significant effect was observed on the plasma levels of carbamazepine or its active metabolite. 
Cyclosporin
: Some of the related macrolide antibiotics interfere with the metabolism of cyclosporin. In the absence of conclusive data from pharmacokinetic studies or clinical data investigating potential interactions between azithromycin and cyclosporine, caution should be exercised before co-administration of these two drugs. If coadministrations is necessary, cyclosporin levels should be monitored and the dose adjusted accordingly. 
Digoxin
: Some of the macrolide antibiotics have been reported to impair the metabolism of digoxin (in the gut) in some patients. Therefore, in patients receiving concomitant azithromycin and digoxin the possibility of raised digoxin levels should be borne in mind and digoxin levels monitored. 
Ergot derivatives
: Because of the theoretical possibility of ergotism, azithromycin and ergot derivatives should not be co-administered. 
Methylprednisolone
: In a pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers, azithromycin had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of methylprednisolone. 
Theophylline
: There is no evidence of any pharmacokinetic interaction when azithromycin and theophylline are co-administered to healthy volunteers. In general, however, theophylline levels should be monitored. 
Warfarin
: In a pharmacodynamic interaction study, azithromycin did not alter the anticoagulant effect of a single 15 mg dose of warfarin administered to healthy volunteers. Acos and warfarin may be co-administered, but monitoring of the prothrombin time should be continued as routinely performed. 
Terfenadine
: Acos did not affect the pharmacokinetics of terfenadine administered at the recommended dose of 60 mg every 12 hours. Addition of azithromycin did not result in any significant changes in cardiac repolarisation (QTc interval) measured during the steady state dosing of terfenadine.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Azithromycin Dihydrate is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to Azithromycin or any other macrolide antibiotic. Co-administration of ergot derivatives and Azithromycin is contraindicated. Azithromycin is contraindicated in patients with hepatic diseases.
                    










Side Effects





                            Acos is well tolerated with a low incidence of side-effects. Most side-effects observed were mild to moderate in severity. The majority of side-effects were gastrointestinal in origin with nauseas, abdominal discomfort (pain/cramps), vomiting, flatulence, diarrhoea and loose stools being occasionally observed. Allergic reactions such as rash or photosensitivity have occurred and there have also been rare reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions. Reversible elevations in liver transaminases have been seen with a frequency similar to the comparative macrolides and penicillins used in clinical trials. Rarely, cases of cholestatic jaundice have been observed. Transient mild reductions in neutrofil counts have occasionally been observed in clinical trials, although a causal relationship to azithromycin has not been established. Hearing impairment: In investigational studies where higher doses were used for prolonged periods of time, reversible hearing impairment was seen in some patients.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy Category of Azithromycin Dihydrate is B. Animal reproduction studies have demonstrated that Azithromycin has no evidence of harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Since animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if adequate alternatives are not available. It is not known whether Azithromycin is secreted in breast milk. So, caution should be exercised when Azithromycin is administered to nursing women.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            As with erythromycin and other macrolides, rare serious allergic reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylaxis, has been reported. Some of these reactions with azithromycin have resulted in recurrent symptoms and required a long period of observation and treatment.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Use in renal impairment
: No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance >40 ml/min), but there are no data regarding azithromycin in patients with more severe renal impairment, thus caution should be exercised in using azithromycin in these patients.
Use in hepatic impairment
: As the liver is the principal route of excretion of azithromycin, it should not be used in patients with hepatic disease.
Effects on ability to drive and use machines
: There is no evidence to suggest that azithromycin may have an effect on a patient’s ability to drive or operate machinery.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            There is no data on overdosage with Acos. Typical symptoms of overdosage with macrolide antibiotics include hearing loss, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Gastric lavage and general supportive measures are indicated.
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Keep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.

Description





                            Acryth belongs to the macrolides group of antibiotics. It exerts a bacteriostatic or bactericidal action based on specific interference with ribosomal protein synthesis within the bacterial cell. THROCIN is mainly used for the treatment of infections caused by penicillinase producing staphylococci. The following micro-organisms are particularly susceptible to Acryth. Gram (+)ve : Cocci and bacilli. Gram (-)ve : Neisseria catarhalis, N.meningitis, N.gonorrhoea, Haemophilus influenzae, Brodetella, H. pertussis.Other micro-organisms : Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Bacteroides fragilis, B.oralis, B.melaninogenicus, Fusobacterium, Chlamydia trachomatis, Treponema pallidum.
                    




















Pharmacology





                            Erythromycin inhibits microsomal protein synthesis in susceptible organisms by inhibiting the translocation process. Specific binding to the 50S subunit or 70S ribosome occurs in these organisms but there is no binding to the stable 80S mammalian ribosome. Erythromycin is active against many Grampositive bacteria, some Gram-negative bacteria and against mycoplasmas and chlamydia.
Absorption
: Erythromycin base is destroyed by acid and is therefore administered in the form of stable ester. The rates of absorption of the base and esters are diminished by the presence of food. The stearate is hydrolyzed in the intestine and the free erythromycin absorbed. 
Blood concentration
: After an oral dose of 500 mg. of the base of stearate, peak serum concentrations of 0.9 to 1.4 or 0.4 to 1.8 mg/ml. respectively are attained in 1 to 4 hours. Half-life: The serum half-life is 1.2 to 4 hours. In subjects with oliguria, the half-life is about 5 hours.
Distribution
: Erythromycin is widely distributed throughout body tissue and fluids with some retention in the liver and spleen, protein binding of erythromycin base is 73%. Erythromycin enters the cerebrospinal fluid when the meninges are inflamed. It also crosses the placenta and is excreted in the milk.
Excretion
: 5 to 15 % of the dose of erythromycin is excreted in the urine and large amounts of the unchanged active substance are excreted in the bile.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adult and Children over 8 years
: 250-500 mg every six hours for mild to moderate infections. This may be increased upto 4 gm. or more daily in severe cases.
Elderly
: No special dosage recommendation. Erythromycin may be administered if desired, three times daily or twice daily by giving one-third or half of the total daily requirement 8 hourly or 12 hourly respectively. 
Children aged 2 to 8 years
: 250 mg. every six hours or 30-50 mg/kg body weight per day divided into four equal dosage. 
Infants and Children upto 2 years
: 500 mg. in divided doses or 30-50 mg/kg body weight in divided doses.

Interaction





                            Recent data from studies of Acryth reveals that its use in patients who are receiving high dosage of theophylline may be associated with an increase of serum theophylline levels and potential theophylline toxicity. In such cases this dose of theophylline should be reduced.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Known hypersensitivity to Erythromycin.
                    










Side Effects





                            Allergic reactions are rare and mild although anaphylaxis has occurred. Occasionally there is abdominal discomfort after oral administration, sometimes with nausea and vomiting. This discomfort usually subsides after a few days without it being necessary to reduce the dosage.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Clinical and Laboratory studies have been shown no evidence in human of teratogenicity or toxicity. However, caution should be exercised when prescribing this drug to pregnant patients and lactating mothers since erythromycin crosses the placental barrier and is excreted in breast milk.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Acryth should be given with care in patients with impaired hepatic function, as Acryth is excreted principally in the bile.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            In case of overdosage, Acryth should be discontinued. Overdosage should be handled with the prompt elimination of unabsorbed drug and all other appropriate measures should be instituted. Acryth is not removed by peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Anti-diarrhoeal Antimicrobial drugs, Macrolides

Pharmacology





                            Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat

Interaction





                            Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Act. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Act overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Act levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of Act are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care is advised in the administration of Act to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Act-containing products concurrently. Act should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of Act in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Act. Use caution when administering Act in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Act IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Act IV in patients with Act allergy.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of Act IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Act IV in adults.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
: Act is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Act may be warranted.
Patients with Renal Impairment
: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Act may be warranted.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Act. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Act may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms
: Symptoms of Act overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Act overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Act concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Act. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.

Do not use Act IV in patients with Act allergy.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of Act IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Act IV in adults.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
: Act is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Act may be warranted.
Patients with Renal Impairment
: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Act may be warranted.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Act. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Act may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms
: Symptoms of Act overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Act overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Act concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Act. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.

Pharmacology





                            Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat

Interaction





                            Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Act. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Act overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Act levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of Act are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care is advised in the administration of Act to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Act-containing products concurrently. Act should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of Act in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Act. Use caution when administering Act in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Act IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Act IV in patients with Act allergy.

Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Act. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Act may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms

Pharmacology





                            This is a combination of Paracetamol and Caffeine. Paracetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Caffeine is an alkaloid which is a theophylline-like xanthine derivative. By intermolecular association with Paracetamol, Caffeine increases the solubility and transmembrane permeation of Paracetamol. In addition, Caffeine increases the pain threshold and tolerance of pain. Caffeine has also an intrinsic power to raise vessel tone in the brain, which provides another benefit to treat migraine and headache.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adult dose
: 1-2 tablets every 4-6 hours. Maximum dose: 8 tablets daily. 
Child dose
: Not recommended for children below 12 years.

Pharmacology





                            Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized anti-human interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor monoclonal antibody of the
immunoglobulin IgG1K (gamma 1, kappa) subclass. Tocilizumab binds to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors, and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors. IL-6 is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types including T-cells and B-cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, and fibroblasts. IL-6 has been shown to be involved in diverse physiological processes such as T-cell activation, induction of immunoglobulin secretion, initiation of hepatic acute phase
protein synthesis, and stimulation of hematopoietic precursor cell proliferation and differentiation. IL-6 is also produced by synovial and endothelial cells leading to local production of IL-6 in joints affected by inflammatory processes such as rheumatoid arthritis.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            Interruption of dosing may be needed for management of dose-related laboratory abnormalities including elevated liver enzymes, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.

Pharmacology





                            Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized anti-human interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor monoclonal antibody of the
immunoglobulin IgG1K (gamma 1, kappa) subclass. Tocilizumab binds to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors, and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors. IL-6 is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types including T-cells and B-cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, and fibroblasts. IL-6 has been shown to be involved in diverse physiological processes such as T-cell activation, induction of immunoglobulin secretion, initiation of hepatic acute phase
protein synthesis, and stimulation of hematopoietic precursor cell proliferation and differentiation. IL-6 is also produced by synovial and endothelial cells leading to local production of IL-6 in joints affected by inflammatory processes such as rheumatoid arthritis.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            Interruption of dosing may be needed for management of dose-related laboratory abnormalities including elevated liver enzymes, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.

Composition





                            Each capsule contains-




Lactobacillus acidophilus (2 billion)


Lactobacillus bulgaricus (1 billion)


Bifidobacterium bifidum (1 billion) as a 4 billion probiotic combination and


Fructo-oligosaccharides (100 mg).
























Description





                            Acterias are defined as live microorganisms, including Lactobacillus species, Bifidobacterium species and yeasts, which may beneficially affect the host upon ingestion by improving the balance of the intestinal microflora.
Lactobacillus acidophilus is one of the several bacteria in the genus Lactobacillus. It gets its name from lacto-meaning milk, bacillus-meaning rod-like in shape and acidophilus-meaning acid-loving. L. acidophilus occurs naturally in a variety of foods, including dairy, grain, meat and fish. It is also present in human (and animal) intestines, mouths and vaginas. These types of healthy bacteria inhabit in the intestines and vaginas and protect against some unhealthy organisms.
Lactobacillus bulgaricus is one of several bacteria used for the production of yogurt. First identified in 1905 by the Bulgarian doctor Stamen Grigorov, it is named after Bulgaria. Morphologically, it is a gram-positive rod that may appear long and filamentous. It is also non-motile and it does not form spores. The bacterium feeds on milk and produces lactic acid which also helps to preserve the milk. It breaks down lactose and is often helpful to sufferers of lactose intolerance, whose digestive systems lack the enzymes to break down lactose to simpler sugars. While fermenting milk, Lactobacillus bulgaricus produces acetaldehyde, which perfumes yogurt. 
Bifidobacteria are normal inhabitants of the human and animal colon. Newborns, especially those that are breast-fed, are colonized with bifidobacteria within days after birth. Bifidobacteria were first isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants. They are gram-positive anaerobes, non-motile, non spore forming and catalase-negative. Their name is derived from the observation that they often exist in a 'Y'-shaped or bifid form. To date 30 species of bifidobacteria have been isolated.
                    




















Pharmacology





                            Studies of probiotic activity in recent years provide evidence that probiotics counter experimental and human gastrointestinal inflammation (human inflammatory bowel disease) by their effects on epithelial cell function, including epithelial cell barrier function, epithelial cytokine secretion and their antibacterial effects relating to colonization of the epithelial layer. It reduces gastrointestinal pH through stimulation of lactic-acid-producing bacteria; provide a direct antagonistic action on gastrointestinal pathogens. Moreover it competes with pathogens for binding and receptor sites. In addition, there is emerging evidence that probiotics induce regulatory T cells that act as a break on the effector T cells that would otherwise cause inflammation.
Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum appear to enhance the nonspecific immune phagocytic activity of circulating blood granulocytes. This effect may account, in part, for the stimulation of IgA responses in infants infected with rotavirus. Lactic acid bacteria, like strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus have also demonstrated antioxidant ability. Mechanisms include chelation of metal ions (iron, copper), scavenging of reactive oxygen species and reducing activity.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            1 or 2 probiotics capsules 3 times daily or as directed by the physician.

Interaction





                            None well documented.
                    




















Contraindications





                            The use of probiotics is not advised in patients at risk of opportunistic infections and in those with badly damaged GI tracts.
                    










Side Effects





                            No known toxicity or side-effects.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Probiotics are unlikely to reach the systemic circulation of the fetus & therefore are unlikely to cause harm. Probiotics are unlikely to be transferred into breast milk.

Their name is derived from the observation that they often exist in a 'Y'-shaped or bifid form. To date 30 species of bifidobacteria have been isolated.
                    




















Pharmacology





                            Studies of probiotic activity in recent years provide evidence that probiotics counter experimental and human gastrointestinal inflammation (human inflammatory bowel disease) by their effects on epithelial cell function, including epithelial cell barrier function, epithelial cytokine secretion and their antibacterial effects relating to colonization of the epithelial layer. It reduces gastrointestinal pH through stimulation of lactic-acid-producing bacteria; provide a direct antagonistic action on gastrointestinal pathogens. Moreover it competes with pathogens for binding and receptor sites. In addition, there is emerging evidence that probiotics induce regulatory T cells that act as a break on the effector T cells that would otherwise cause inflammation.
Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum appear to enhance the nonspecific immune phagocytic activity of circulating blood granulocytes. This effect may account, in part, for the stimulation of IgA responses in infants infected with rotavirus. Lactic acid bacteria, like strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus have also demonstrated antioxidant ability. Mechanisms include chelation of metal ions (iron, copper), scavenging of reactive oxygen species and reducing activity.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            1 or 2 probiotics capsules 3 times daily or as directed by the physician.

Pharmacology





                            Dexketoprofen is the S(+)-enantiomer of Ketoprofen and is responsible for the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity of Ketoprofen. The inactive R(-)-enantiomer does not contribute to the therapeutic properties of Ketoprofen but adds to the metabolic load. Dexketoprofen has been formulated as a trometamol salt. Its high solubility in water means a rapid absorption through the gut wall which results in a more rapid onset of action than Ketoprofen. Peak plasma concentrations are attained more quickly than other widely used analgesics with an onset of action of 30 minutes. Dexketoprofen trometamol, given as a tablet, is rapidly absorbed, with a time to maximum plasma concentration (t
max
) of between 0.25 and 0.75 hours, whereas the t
max
 for the S-enantiomer after the racemic drug, administered as tablets or capsules prepared with the free acid, is between 0.5 and 3 hours. Peak plasma concentrations of 1.4 and 3.1 mg/L are reached after administration of Dexketoprofen trometamol 12.5 and 25 mg, respectively. From 70 to 80% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine during the first 12 hours, mainly as the acyl-glucuronoconjugated parent drug. No R(-)-Ketoprofen is found in the urine after administration of Dexketoprofen [S(+)-Ketoprofen], confirming the absence of bioinversion of the S(+)-enantiomer in humans. The anti-inflammatory potency of Dexketoprofen was always equivalent to that demonstrated by twice the dose of Ketoprofen.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            The dose of Dexketoprofen 25 mg tablets depends on the type, severity, and duration of pain. The recommended dose is generally 1 tablet every 8 hours, with no more than 3 tablets daily. The elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment should start treatment with a total daily dose of no more than 2 tablets. Normally it is recommended to take the tablets with food. In the case of acute pain, it is recommended that tablets be taken at least 30 minutes before meals. Dexketoprofen is not recommended for children.

Description





                            Actifast is a drug of pyrrolo-pyrrole group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Chemically it is known as 5 benzoyle-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrroligine-1-carboxylic acid, compound with 2 - amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (1:1). Actifast inhibits synthesis of prostaglandins and may be considered as a peripherally acting analgesic. The biological activity of Actifast is associated with the S-form. Pharmacokinetic property of Actifast is linear. It is highly protein bound and is largely metabolized in liver. The products of metabolism and some unchanged drugs are excreted in the urine.
                    




















Pharmacology





                            Ketorolac Tromethamine is a potent analgesic of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It acts by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme system and hence inhibits the prostaglandin synthesis. It demonstrates a minimal anti-inflammatory effect at its analgesic dose.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Tablet
: Recommended dose is 10 mg every 4-6 hours. It should be used short-term only (up to 7 days) and are not recommended for chronic use. Doses exceeding 40 mg/day is not recommended.
Injection
: Ketorolac injection may be used as a single or multiple doses, on a regular or when necessary schedule for the management of moderately severe, acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting. When administering Ketorolac injection, the IV bolus must be given over no less than 15 seconds. The IM administration should be given slowly and deeply into the muscle. The analgesic effect begins within 30 minutes with maximum effect in 1 to 2 hours after dosing IV or IM. Duration of analgesic effect is usually 4 to 6 hours.

Single-Dose Treatment-
IM Dosing (Adult):

Pharmacology





                            This is the preparation of Calcium Folinate Hydrate which is calcium salt of folinic acid (5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid). It is a metabolite and active form of folic acid that is involved as a cofactor for 1-carbon transfer reactions in the biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidines of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective DNA synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Because of its ready conversion to other tetrahydrofolic acid derivatives, Folinate is a potent antidote for both hematopoietic and reticuloendothelia toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, (e.g. methotrexate, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim). It is postulated that in some cancers, folinate enters and ""rescues"" normal cells from the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, in preference to tumour cells, because of a difference in membrane transport mechanisms; this principle is the basis of high-dose methotrexate therapy with ""Folinate rescue"".
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Folinic Acid rescue
: Folinic Acid rescue should begin as soon as possible after an inadvertent overdosage and within 24 hours of methotrexate administration when there is delayed excretion. There are no fixed guidelines regarding the dose of methotrexate that triggers an automatic subsequent Folinic Acid administration, since tolerance to this folate antagonist depends on various factors. The dose of methotrexate varies, nevertheless folinate rescue is necessary when methotrexate is given at doses exceeding 500 mg/m2 and has to be considered with doses of 100 mg-500 mg/m2. Folinic Acid rescue treatment should commence approximately 24 hours after the beginning of methotrexate infusion. Dosage regimens vary depending upon the dose of methotrexate administered. In general, Folinic Acid should be administered at a dose of 15 mg (approximately 10 mg/m2) every 6 hours for 10 doses.
The recommended dose of Folinic Acid to counteract hematologic toxicity from folic acid antagonists with less affinity for mammalian dihydrofolate reductase than methotrexate (i.e., trimethoprim, pyrimethamine) is substantially less and 5 mg to 15 mg of Folinic Acid per day has been recommended.
Neutralising the immediate toxic effects of folic acid antagonists
: If overdosage of methotrexate is suspected, the dose of Folinic Acid should be equal to or greater than the dose of methotrexate and should be administered within one hour of the methotrexate administration.
Megaloblastic anaemia (folate deficiency)
: 5 mg to 15 mg of Folinic Acid per day.
Use in children and adolescents
: The safety and efficacy of folinic acid in children and adolescents have not been
established.

Interaction





                            Folinates given in large amounts may counteract the antiepileptic effect of phenobarbitone, phenytoin and primidone and increase the frequency of seizures in susceptible patients. Caution is required during concurrent administration of calcium folinate with fluoropyrimidine as this has been associated with seizures and syncope.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Folinic Acid is contraindicated to patients with known hypersensitivity to calcium folinate or any other components of this product. It is also contraindicated in pernicious anemia or other megaloblastic anemia where vitamin B12 is deficient. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take calcium folinate tablets.
                    










Side Effects





                            The most common side effects of Actifol are mucositis, stomatitis, leukopenia and/or diarrhea, which may be dose-limiting.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            There are no adequate and well-controlled clinical studies conducted in pregnant women. Folinic Acid should only be used in pregnant women if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when calcium folinate is administered to a nursing mother.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Actifol should only be used with methotrexate or 5-FU under the direct supervision of a clinician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. In the treatment of inadvertent overdosage of a folic acid antagonist, folinate should be administered as soon as possible; if a period exceeding 4 hours intervenes, the treatment may not be effective. In general, Actifol should not be given simultaneously with folic acid antagonists, e.g. methotrexate, to abort clinical toxicity as the therapeutic effect of the antagonist may be nullified. Flowever, Actifol given concurrently with folate antagonists, such as pyrimethamine and trimethoprim does not inhibit their antibacterial activity. Measures to ensure the prompt excretion of methotrexate are important as part of Actifol Rescue Therapy. These measures include:




Alkalinisation of urine so that the urinary pH is greater than 7.0 before methotrexate infusion (to increase solubility of methotrexate and its metabolites).


Maintenance of urine output of 1800-2000 cc/m
2
/24 hour by increased oral or intravenous fluids on days 2, 3 and 4 following methotrexate therapy.


Plasma methotrexate concentration, BUN and creatinine should be measured on days 2, 3 and 4. These measures must be continued until the plasma methotrexate level is less than 10
-7
 molar.












Overdose Effects





                            There have been no reported sequelae in patients who have received significantly more calcium folinate than the recommended dosage. Flowever, excessive amounts of calcium folinate may nullity the chemotherapeutic effect of folic acid antagonists. There is no specific antidote to calcium folinate overdose. In cases of overdosage patients should be given appropriate supportive care.

                            Each tablet contains-




Calcium Folinate Hydrate BP 6.249 mg equivalent to Folinic Acid 5 mg.


Calcium Folinate Hydrate BP 18.746 mg equivalent to Folinic Acid 15 mg.




































Pharmacology





                            This is the preparation of Calcium Folinate Hydrate which is calcium salt of folinic acid (5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid). It is a metabolite and active form of folic acid that is involved as a cofactor for 1-carbon transfer reactions in the biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidines of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective DNA synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Because of its ready conversion to other tetrahydrofolic acid derivatives, Folinate is a potent antidote for both hematopoietic and reticuloendothelia toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, (e.g. methotrexate, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim). It is postulated that in some cancers, folinate enters and ""rescues"" normal cells from the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, in preference to tumour cells, because of a difference in membrane transport mechanisms; this principle is the basis of high-dose methotrexate therapy with ""Folinate rescue"".

Constipation (Chronic Constipation): In every case of chronic constipation, initial treatment should consist of a diet rich in fiber (vegetables, salads, fruits etc.) a generous amount of liquids and much physical exercise. Actilac is only to be taken when these measures prove insufficient.
Intestinal flora disturbances:




In damaged to intestinal flora (e.g. following long-term antibiotic treatment)


Gall bladder diseases


Intestinal diseases (Colitis, Diverticulosis, Megacolon)



Increased blood ammonia levels (hyper ammoniemia in hepatopathy, portal-systemic encephalopathy)

Description





                            Actilac is a hyperosmolar laxative which is used as an effective treatment approach for constipation. It is a non-absorbable disaccharide which draws water into the bowel; causes distention through fluid accumulation, thus promotes soft stool and accelerates bowel motion.
                    




















Pharmacology





                            Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide. Lactulose is metabolized in the colon by the saccharolytic bacteria, producing low molecular weight organic acids (mainly lactic acid), which lowers the pH of the colon contents, promote the retention of water by an osmotic effect; thus increasing peristaltic activity. Lactulose is minimally absorbed; therefore, the pharmacokinetics of the absorbed material are not relevant to the principal therapeutic action.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            In constipation ( chronic constipation): 




Adults
: Initially 3-6 tea-spoons daily, In long-term therapy 1½-6 tea-spoons daily


Children up to 14 years
: Initially 3 tea-spoons daily, In long-term therapy 1-2 tea-spoons daily


Infants and toddlers
: Initially 1-2 tea-spoons daily, In long-term therapy 1 tea-spoon daily



In damaged intestinal flora:




Adults
: 1-2 tea-spoons daily


Children
: 1 tea-spoon daily



For reduction of blood ammonia level: 




Hyper-ammoniemia in hepatopathy
: a maximum of 18-30 tea-spoons daily.


In portal systemic encephalopathy
: hourly doses of 6-9 tea-spoons of Lactulose solution may be used to induce the rapid laxation. When the laxative effect has been achieved, the dose may then be reduced.

'




















Interaction





                            There is no significant drug interactions with Actilac. The glycosidic effect of cardiac glycosides can be intensified by potassium deficiency in abuse.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Hypersensitivity to either galactose and or lactose; galactose-free diet, gastro-cardial symptom complex, suspected intestinal obstruction.
                    










Side Effects





                            Occasionally flatulence, cramp and abdominal discomfort can occur at the beginning of treatment; this is rapidly eliminated by reducing the dose. Overdose can result in diarrhoea. In abuse, loss of electrolytes (primarily potassium).
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            US FDA Pregnancy Category of Lactulose is B. Studies show that Lactulose has no adverse effects. Decisions regarding use during pregnancy and lactation must be made by registered physician.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Actilac should be administered with care to patients who are intolerant to Actilac. The dose used in the treatment of (pre) coma hepaticum is usually much higher and may need to be taken into consideration for diabetics.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            There have been no reports of accidental overdosage. In the event of acute overdosage it is expected that diarrhoea and abdominal cramps would be the major symptoms.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Osmotic purgatives
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Keep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.

Pharmacology





                            Alteplase is a serine protease responsible for fibrin-enhanced conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. It produces limited conversion of plasminogen in the absence of fibrin. When introduced into the systemic circulation at pharmacologic concentration, alteplase binds to fibrin in a thrombus and converts the entrapped plasminogen to plasmin. This initiates local fibrinolysis with limited systemic proteolysis.
Pharmacodynamics
: Following administration of 100 mg Alteplase, there is a decrease (16%-36%) in circulating fibrinogen. In a controlled trial, 8 of 73 patients (11%) receiving Alteplase (1.25 mg/kg body weight over 3 hours) experienced a decrease in fibrinogen to below 100 mg/dL.
Pharmacokinetics
: Alteplase in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients is rapidly cleared from the plasma with an initial half-life of less than 5 minutes. There is no difference in the dominant initial plasma half-life between the 3-hour and accelerated regimens for AMI. The plasma clearance of alteplase is 380-570 mL/min, primarily mediated by the liver. The initial volume of distribution approximates plasma volume.
                    
























Dosage






Acute Ischemic Stroke
: Administer Alteplase as soon as possible but within 3 hours after onset of symptoms. The recommended dose is 0.9 mg/kg (not to exceed 90 mg total dose), with 10% of the total dose administered as an initial intravenous bolus over 1 minute and the remainder infused over 60 minutes. During and following Alteplase administration for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, frequently monitor and control blood pressure. In patients without recent use of oral anticoagulants or heparin, Alteplase treatment can be initiated prior to the availability of coagulation study results. Discontinue Alteplase if the pretreatment International Normalized Ratio (INR) is greater than 1.7 or the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is elevated.
Acute Myocardial Infarction
: Administer Alteplase as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms. The recommended total doses for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is based on patient weight, not to exceed 100 mg, regardless of the selected administration regimen (accelerated or 3 hour). There are two Alteplase dose regimens (accelerated and 3-hour) for use in the management of AMI; there are no controlled studies to compare clinical outcomes with these regimens
Pulmonary Embolism (PE)
: The recommended dose is 100 mg administered by IV infusion over 2 hours. Institute parenteral anticoagulation near the end of or immediately following the Alteplase infusion when the partial thromboplastin time or thrombin time returns to twice normal or less.

Administration





                            Following bolus dose, if indicated:




50 mg vials
: administer using either a polyvinyl chloride bag or glass vial and infusion set.


100 mg vials
: remove from the vial any quantity of drug in excess of that specified for patient treatment. Insert the spike end of an infusion set through the same puncture site created by the transfer device in the stopper of the vial of reconstituted Alteplase. Peel the clear plastic hanger from the vial label. Hang the Alteplase vial from the resulting loop.



Alteplase is for intravenous administration only. Extravasation of Alteplase infusion can cause ecchymosis or inflammation. If extravasation occurs, terminate the infusion at that IV site and apply local therapy. Do not add any other medication to infusion solutions containing Alteplase.

Interaction





                            The interaction of Actilyse with other cardioactive or cerebroactive drugs has not been studied. Anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after Actilyse therapy. In the post-marketing setting, there have been reports of orolingual angioedema in patients (primarily patients with AIS) receiving concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.
                    




















Contraindications






Acute Ischemic Stroke
: Do not administer Alteplase to treat acute ischemic stroke in the following situations in which the risk of bleeding is greater than the potential benefit [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]:




Current intracranial hemorrhage


Subarachnoid hemorrhage


Active internal bleeding


Recent (within 3 months) intracranial or intraspinal surgery or serious head trauma


Presence of intracranial conditions that may increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., some neoplasms, arteriovenous malformations, or aneurysms)


Bleeding diathesis


Current severe uncontrolled hypertension.




Acute Myocardial Infarction or Pulmonary Embolism
: Do not administer Alteplase for treatment of AMI or PE in the following situations in which the risk of bleeding is greater than the potential benefit:




Active internal bleeding


History of recent stroke


Recent (within 3 months) intracranial or intraspinal surgery or serious head trauma


Presence of intracranial conditions that may increase the risk of bleeding (e.g. some neoplasms, arteriovenous malformations, or aneurysms)


Bleeding diathesis


Current severe uncontrolled hypertension.














Side Effects





                            The following adverse reactions are:




Bleeding 


Orolingual Angioedema 


Cholesterol Embolization


Reembolization of Deep Venous Thrombi during Treatment for Acute Massive Pulmonary


Embolism.














Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy Category C. Alteplase is embryocidal in rabbits when intravenously administered in doses of approximately two times (3 mg/kg) the human dose for AMI. No maternal or fetal toxicity was evident at 0.65 times (1 mg/kg) the human dose in pregnant rats and rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It is not known whether Alteplase is excreted in human milk. Many drugs are excreted in human milk.
                    








Precautions & Warnings








Increases the risk of bleeding. Avoid intramuscular injections. Monitor for bleeding. If serious bleeding occurs, discontinue Actilyse.


Monitor patients during and for several hours after infusion for orolingual angioedema. If angioedema develops, discontinue Actilyse.


Cholesterol embolism has been reported rarely in patients treated with thrombolytic agents.


Consider the risk of reembolization from the lysis of underlying deep venous thrombi in patients with pulmonary embolism.












Use in Special Populations





                            Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of Actilyse in pediatric patients have not been established.
Geriatric Use:




Acute Ischemic Stroke
: In exploratory, multivariate analyses of Studies 1 and 2, age greater than 77 years was one of several interrelated baseline characteristics associated with an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Efficacy results suggest a reduced but still favorable clinical outcome for Actilyse-treated elderly.


Acute Myocardial Infarction
: In a large trial of accelerated-infusion Actilyse that enrolled 41,021 patients with AMI to one of four thrombolytic regimens [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], patients over 75 years of age, a predefined subgroup, comprised 12% of enrolment. In these patients, the incidence of stroke was 4.0% for the Actilyse accelerated infusion group, 2.8% for streptokinase IV [SK (IV)], and 3.2% for streptokinase SQ [SK (SQ)]. The incidence of combined 30-day mortality or nonfatal stroke was 20.6% for accelerated infusion of Actilyse, 21.5% for SK (IV), and 22.0% for SK (SQ).












Therapeutic Class





                            Anti-platelet drugs, Fibrinolytics (Thrombolytics)
                    








Storage Conditions





                            Store lyophilized Actilyse at controlled room temperature not to exceed 30°C, or under refrigeration (2-8°C). Protect the lyophilized material during extended storage from excessive exposure to light. If stored between 2-30°C, Actilyse may be used within 8 hours following reconstitution. Discard any unused solution after administration is complete. Do not use beyond the expiration date stamped on the vial.

Pharmacology





                            Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat

Interaction





                            Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Action XR. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Action XR overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Action XR levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.
                    










Side Effects





                            Side effects of Action XR are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Care is advised in the administration of Action XR to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Action XR-containing products concurrently. Action XR should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.
Administration of Action XR in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Action XR. Use caution when administering Action XR in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Action XR IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Action XR IV in patients with Action XR allergy.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Pediatric Use
: The safety and effectiveness of Action XR IV for the treatment of acute pain and fever in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Action XR IV in adults.
Geriatric use
: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment
: Action XR is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease. A reduced total daily dose of Action XR may be warranted.
Patients with Renal Impairment
: In cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose of Action XR may be warranted.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Action XR. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Action XR may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms
: Symptoms of Action XR overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Action XR overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Action XR concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Action XR. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.

Pharmacology





                            Levosalbutamol is a single isomer beta 2-agonist that differs from racemic salbutamol by elimination of (S)-salbutamol. Levosalbutamol is an effective bronchodilator whose primary mechanism of action is unimpeded by (S)-salbutamol. Thus, when compared with racemic salbutamol, clinically comparable bronchodilation can be achieved with doses that substantially lessen beta-mediated side effects.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            Tablet-




Adults and adolescents above 12 years: 1-2 mg three times daily.


Children (6 -11 years): 1 mg three times daily.



Syrup-




Adults : 5-10 ml three times daily.


Childrn (6-11 years): 5 ml three times daily.

Interaction





                            Other short acting sympathomimetic bronchodilators or epinephrine should be used with caution with Actisal. If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they will be used with caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular effects.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Levosalbutamol is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to levosalbutamol or any of its components.
                    










Side Effects





                            Hypocalcaemia, palpitation, fine tremors of the skeletal muscle and muscle cramps may occur. The other likely side effects are nausea, vomiting, burning substernal or epigastric pain and diarrhoea.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            The drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus. It is not known whether Levosalbutamol is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when oral Levosalbutamol is administered to a nursing woman.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Particular caution is advised in acute severe asthma as this effect may be potentiated by hypoxia and by concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, steroids and diuretics. Serum potassium levels should be monitored in such situations.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            The expected symptoms with over dosage are those of excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation and the symptoms listed under side effects. In the event of serious poisoning, the stomach should be emptied and, if necessary, a beta-blocker administered with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.

Indications





                            Treatment of men with erectile dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. In order for Activa to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. Activa is also indicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Description





                            Activa is a selective, reversible inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). When sexual stimulation causes the local release of nitric oxide; inhibition of PDE5 by Activa produces increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This results in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood into the penile tissues, thereby producing an erection. Activa has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.
                    




















Pharmacology






Mechanism of Action
: The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.
Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism
: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, Sildenafil. Both Sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours.
Absorption and Distribution
: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When Sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced.
Metabolism and Excretion
: Sildenafil is cleared by hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. After either oral or intravenous administration, Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose).
Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations
: Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of Sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of Sildenafil compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Erectile dysfunction
: For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Sildenafil may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day.
The following factors are associated with increased plasma levels of Sildenafil
: age >65, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir). Since higher plasma levels may increase both the efficacy and incidence of adverse events, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in these patients. Sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated. When Sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alphablocker therapy prior to initiating Sildenafil treatment and Sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension
: The recommended dose of sildenafil citrate is 20 mg three times a day and should be taken approximately 4-6 hours apart, with or without food.

Interaction





                            Activa metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major route) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes 15 may reduce Activa clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase Activa clearance. Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma Activa concentrations when coadministered with Activa (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of Activa was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in Activa systemic exposure (AUC). In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Activa (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Activa Cmax and a 210% increase in Activa AUC. Activa had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Activa clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Activa (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Activa Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Activa plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Activa were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Activa was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Activa had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Activa has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Activa levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Activa at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Activa AUC and a 55% decrease in Activa Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Activa. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Activa. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Activa pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Activa, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Sildenafil is contraindicated in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Sildenafil potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitrates, so it is contraindicated in patients who are using organic nitrates, either regularly or intermittently.

Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Pregnancy category B. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Sildenafil in pregnant women. Sildenafil is not indicated for use by women. In animal study shows that Sildenafil has no evidence of teratogenicity or embryotoxicity.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment.
Before prescribing Activa, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Activa, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting).
Consideration should be given to the following:




Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors.


In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose.


In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. A stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor.


Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs.


Activa has systemic vasodilatory properties and may augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of other anti-hypertensive medications.


Patients on multiple antihypertensive medications were included in the pivotal clinical trials for Activa. In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and Activa, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted.


The safety of Activa is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration.


Activa should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia).


The safety and efficacy of combinations of Activa with other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended.



There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Activa, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Activa has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Activa, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity.
Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Activa - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure.
There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Activa in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution.




Patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months;


Patients with resting hypotension (BP <90/50) or hypertension (BP >170/110);


Patients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina;


Patients with retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases);


Patients with sickle cell or related anemias.



Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Activa. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Activa is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Activa are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Activa exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Activa (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Activa dosage is recommended.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            In studies with healthy volunteers of single doses up to 800 mg, adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses but incidence rates and severities were increased. 24 In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Renal dialysis is not expected to accelerate clearance as Activa is highly bound to plasma proteins and it is not eliminated in the urine.

Description





                            Activa is a selective, reversible inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). When sexual stimulation causes the local release of nitric oxide; inhibition of PDE5 by Activa produces increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This results in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood into the penile tissues, thereby producing an erection. Activa has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.
                    




















Pharmacology






Mechanism of Action
: The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.
Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism
: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, Sildenafil. Both Sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours.
Absorption and Distribution
: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When Sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced.
Metabolism and Excretion
: Sildenafil is cleared by hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. After either oral or intravenous administration, Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose).
Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations
: Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of Sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of Sildenafil compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Erectile dysfunction
: For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Sildenafil may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day.
The following factors are associated with increased plasma levels of Sildenafil
: age >65, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir). Since higher plasma levels may increase both the efficacy and incidence of adverse events, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in these patients. Sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated. When Sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alphablocker therapy prior to initiating Sildenafil treatment and Sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension
: The recommended dose of sildenafil citrate is 20 mg three times a day and should be taken approximately 4-6 hours apart, with or without food.

Interaction





                            Activa metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major route) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes 15 may reduce Activa clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase Activa clearance. Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma Activa concentrations when coadministered with Activa (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of Activa was administered with erythromycin, a specific CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in Activa systemic exposure (AUC). In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with Activa (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in Activa Cmax and a 210% increase in Activa AUC. Activa had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole would be expected to have still greater effects, and population data from patients in clinical trials did indicate a reduction in Activa clearance when it was coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine). In another study in healthy male volunteers, coadministration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with Activa (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in Activa Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in Activa plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of Activa were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when Activa was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Activa had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and Activa has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase Activa levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of Activa at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of cytochrome P450 2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of Activa AUC and a 55% decrease in Activa Cmax. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of Activa. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of Activa. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on Activa pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl Activa, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by 16 nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence.

Antioxidant vitamins are used in a wide range of conditions where free radical damage is playing a role. Antioxidant vitamin combination is used in the prevention of coronary heart diseases, certain types of cancer, aging as well as free radical damage caused by excessive exercise, illness, certain medications, air pollution, smoke, radiation and pesticides. The main role of the antioxidant vitamins is as follows:
β carotene prevents free radical formation by quenching singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of oxygen. Vitamin C is another free radical scavenger which deactivates free radicals. It works specially in the plasma, lung fluid, aqueous humour and interstitial fluid. It can increase white blood cell activity; play important roles in the biochemistry of antibodies, prostaglandin E 1 , B and T lymphocytes, and interferon. Vitamin E also scavenges free radicals in the blood along with β carotene and vitamin C. Moreover, vitamin E is essential to protect against some of the ill effects of smog and smoke. In relation to other nutrients vitamin E protects vitamin A from being destroyed in the body.

Pharmacology






Beta carotene
 of this tablet is converted to vitamin A (Retinol) when required. Retinol has several biochemical functions e.g. on retina, growth, tissue differentiation, immunological response. It has also some anti-cancer activity.
Vitamin C
 is the most powerful reducing agent known to be present in living tissues. Vitamin C deficiency produces scurvy. It is a cofactor in numerous biological processes. Vitamin C and molecular oxygen are essential for the conversion of proline to hydroxyproline, dopamine to noradrenaline . Vitamin C is also essential for the synthesis of adrenal steroid hormones. Vitamin C is important in the defense against infection and studies shown that vitamin C is important for the normal functioning of T-lymphocyte and leukocyte. Ascorbic acid has some antiinflammatory activity and protects cells against oxidation of essential molecules. In high doses, (1-2 g daily) ascorbic acid increases iron absorption.
vitamin E
 seems to be as a defense against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In most cell membranes there is one molecule of tocopherol for every 1000 lipid molecules. Tocopherol mops up peroxide radicals and then needs a supply of reduced hydrogen to restore the steady-state situation. This is usually supplied by ascorbic acid or reduced glutathione.
                    
























Dosage & Administration





                            This tablet is administered orally. The adult dose of this combination of antioxidant vitamin tablet is 1 tablet daily or as prescribed by the physician.

Interaction





                            Cholestyramine, Colestipol, Neomycin cause decreased absorption of β carotene. Circulating vitamin C levels have been shown to be reduced during prolonged administration of oral contraceptives containing Oestrogen, Tetracycline and Aspirin. The decrease in vitamin C level may be due to drug induced impaired absorption or increased utilization of the vitamin for drug metabolism. Vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of anticoagulant drugs. High doses of vitamin E can impair intestinal absorption of vitamins A and K.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Carocet is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components.
                    










Side Effects






β carotene
 is comparatively safe even at high and prolonged exposure. Individuals who routinely ingest large amounts of carotenoids can develop hypercarotenosis, which is characterised by a yellowish colouration of the skin and a very high concentration of carotenoids in the plasma. This benign condition, although resembling jaundice, gradually disappears upon correcting the excessive intake of carotenoids.
Vitamin C
 is generally a safe drug for human use in normal doses. Larger doses may lead to gastrointestinal tract upset and renal stone formation.
Vitamin E
 is considered safe even in large doses. Doses over 800 mg may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain or cramps, fatigue and reduced resistance to bacterial infection and transiently raised blood pressure.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            β carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E have no teratogenic effects in humans. However, like any other drugs caution should be taken in prescribing to pregnant women.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            There are some evidences that β carotene may cause harm to heavy smokers and alcoholics. Therefore, caution should be exercised in these cases. Vitamin C should be given with caution to patients with hyperoxaluria. Vitamin E should be used with caution in patients taking anticoagulant drugs, because vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of these drugs.
                    








Therapeutic Class





                            Anti-oxidant Multivitamin preparations

Pharmacology





                            Zinc is vital for many biological functions such as immunity enhancement, wound healing, digestion, reproduction, physical growth and mental development. Zinc supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. Zinc also has some antioxidant properties. Zinc is used to treat ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyper-activity Disorder) in children. In adult, due to zinc deficiency loss of appetite, poor sense of taste and smell, tendency towards depression, white marks on fingernails, frequent infections, low fertility, prostate problems, mental problems, poor wound healing, a poor immune system, diarrhoea, mental lethargy, rough skin and weight loss may occur.
B-Vitamins are needed to release energy from food. They play an important role in ensuring healthy brain and nerve function, healthy red blood cells formation in children & adults. They are specially needed for healthy growth and development of children. B-Vitamin deficiencies in adult cause profound fatigue and various types of neurologic manifestations, which may include weakness, poor balance, confusion, irritability, memory loss, nervousness, tingling of the limbs and loss of coordination. Additional symptoms of vitamin B deficiency are sleep disturbances, nausea, poor appetite, frequent infections, and skin lesions.

Interaction





                            Concomitant intake of tetracyclines and zinc may decrease the Gl absorption and serum levels of tetracyclines. Similarly concomitant administration of zinc and fluroquinolones may decrease the Gl absorption and serum  levels of some fluroquinolones. Coadministration of Niacin and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (eg. lovastatin) may result mayopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Pyridoxine reduces levodopa's effectiveness by increasing its peripheral metabolism. Co-administration of pyridoxine with phenytoin may decrease serum levels of phenytoin.
                    




















Contraindications





                            Vitamin B Complex & Zinc is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of this product.
                    










Side Effects





                            This is generally well tolerated. However, a few side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea & stomach upset may occur. Side effects have been reported with specific vitamins but generally at levels substantially higher than recommended doses.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            This is recommended in pregnancy and lactation.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            In acute renal failure, zinc accumulation may occur, so dosage adjustment is needed. This is not intended for the treatment of severe specific deficiencies.
                    








Overdose Effects





                            In case of overdosage, initially epigastric pain, diarrhoea and vomiting can occur. In that case, one should seek emergency medical attention. Initially, an emetic should be given and then gastric lavage and general supportive measures should be employed.

Composition





                            Each 5 ml syrup contains 




Iron (III) Hydroxide Polymaltose Complex equivalent to elemental Iron 50 mg


Thiamine Hydrochloride 5 mg


Riboflavin-5-Phosphate Sodium equivalent to Riboflavin 2 mg


Pyridoxine Hydrochloride 2 mg


Nicotinamide 20 mg


Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate equivalent to elemental Zinc 10 mg.




































Pharmacology





                            This syrup is the preparation of Iron, Vitamin B complex and Zinc. In this preparation, Iron is present as Iron (III) Hydroxide Polymaltose Complex. Iron (III) Hydroxide Polymaltose Complex facilitates a controlled absorption of the iron when it comes in contact with the mucosal cell surface. Due to non-ionic nature, this Iron (III) Hydroxide Polymaltose Complex is more stable than conventional Iron form.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Adults
: 5 ml-10 ml (1-2 teaspoonful) 3 times daily or as recommended by the physician.
Children
: 5 ml (1 teaspoonful) 3 times daily or as recommended by the physician.
Infants
: 0.33 ml/kg body weight daily or as recommended by the physician.

Interaction





                            Since Iron is complex bound, ionic interaction with foodstuff components (phytates, oxalates, tannin etc.) and concomitant administrations of medicaments (tetracyclines, antacids) are unlikely to occur.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of this product.
                    










Side Effects





                            This syrup is generally well tolerated. However, a few side effects of oral Iron preparations, including nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhoea may occur.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            Recommended in pregnancy & lactation
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Caution should be taken in the conditions where there is a risk of Iron overload, such as hemochromatosis, thalassemia, hemosiderosis or hemolytic anemia.
                    








Use in Special Populations





                            Recommended in children

Indications





                            Actizen is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with seasonal & perennial allergic rhinitis. It is also indicated for the treatment of the uncomplicated skin manifestations of chronic idiopathic urticaria and allergen induced asthma.

Pharmacology





                            Cetirizine Hydrochloride is a potent H1 receptor antagonist without any significant anticholinergic and antiserotonic effects. At pharmacologically active dose levels, it has almost no drowsiness effect and does not cause behavioral changes. It inhibits the histamine-mediated early phase of the allergic reaction and also reduces the migration of inflammatory cells and the release of mediators associated with the late phase of the allergic reaction.
Pharmacokinetics: Cetirizine 10 mg achieves peak plasma concentrations of 257 mcg/L within one hour of administration (980 mcg/L in children). Food does not affect the extent of absorption, but it may slightly reduce the rate. Peak blood levels 0.3 micrograms/ml are reached between thirty & sixty minutes after administration of 10 mg dose of Cetirizine. Its plasma half-life is approximately 11 hours. Absorption is very consistent from one subject to the next. Its renal clearance is 30 ml/minute and the excretion half-life is approximately nine hours.
                    
























Dosage & Administration






Cetirizine oral dosage form
:




Adults and Children 6 years and older: 1 tablet or 2 teaspoonfuls daily (or 1 teaspoonful twice daily).


Children 2-6 years: 1 teaspoonful once daily or 1/2 teaspoonful twice daily.


Children 6 months to 2 years : 1/2 teaspoonful once daily. The dose in children 12-23 months of age can be increased to a maximum dose as 1/2 teaspoonful every 12 hours.




Cetirizine injectable dosage form
: Cetirizine is a single use injectable product for intravenous administration only. The recommended dosage regimen is once every 24 hours as needed for treatment of acute urticaria. Administer Cetirizine as an intravenous push over a period of 1 to 2 minutes. Cetirizine is not recommended in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age with impaired renal or hepatic function.




Adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older: The recommended dosage is 10 mg administered by intravenous injection.


Children 6 to 11 years of age: The recommended dosage is 5 mg or 10 mg depending on symptom severity administered by intravenous injection.


Children 6 months to 5 years of age: The recommended dosage is 2.5 mg administered by intravenous injection.

Interaction





                            No clinically significant drug interactions have been found with Theophylline, Azithromycin, Pseudoephedrine, Ketoconazole or Erythromycin and with other drugs.
                    




















Contraindications





                            It is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to Cetirizine or hydroxyzine.
                    










Side Effects





                            The most common side effects that occurred more frequently on Actizen is somnolence.
                    










Pregnancy & Lactation





                            US FDA Pregnancy Category of Cetirizine Hydrochloride is B. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Cetirizine Hydrochloride has been shown to be excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cetirizine Hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman.
                    








Precautions & Warnings





                            Caution should be exercised when driving a car or operating a heavy machinery.
                    








Use in Special Populations






Hepatic or renal insufficiency
: In patients with mild to moderate hepatic and renal impairment, total body clearance of Actizen is reduced and AUC and half-life increased by about 2 to 3 fold. Clearance is reduced in proportion to the decline in creatinine clearance. Plasma levels are unaffected by hemodialysis. The plasma elimination half-life in dialysis patients is approximately 20 hours and the plasma AUC is increased by about threefold.
Pediatric Use
: The safety of Actizen has been demonstrated in pediatric patients aged 6 months to 5 years.
Elderly use
: The clearance of Actizen is reduced in elderly patients, but only in proportion to the decrease in creatinine clearance.
